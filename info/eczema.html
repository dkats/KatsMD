<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Eczema (atopic dermatitis)</h1>

<h4>What is eczema?</h4>

	<p>Eczema is a common disease that affects roughly 15% of the population. It is hereditary and is usually seen in families where other family members have eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma. The word eczema means "to ooze", which is what eczema skin does when inflamed. The main symptoms are red, dry, and itchy skin. Eczema can happen in cycles/episodes that last weeks to months. It often responds well to treatment and is not contagious.</p>

<h4>What causes eczema?</h4>
	
	<p>The exact cause is unknown, but it is now believed that people with eczema have a defective skin barrier that leads to an imbalance in their immune system, making them overly sensitive to their surroundings. It is best to think of eczema as predisposing one to very sensitive skin.</p>

	<p>Specific triggers can vary based on the child and can include pets, carpet, dust mites, fabrics (such as wool), cigarette smoke, and scented products (such as perfume, laundry detergent, and air freshener).</p>

	<p>Common triggers include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Sweat</li>
		<li>Very hot, cold, dry or humid air</li>
		<li>Dry skin</li>
		<li>Skin irritants (chemicals, soaps, perfumes, and clothes that “rub” the skin too much)</li>
		<li>Emotions</li>
		<li>Allergies to certain things such as environmental allergens like cats, dogs, or dust mites</li>
		<li>Infection</li>
	</ul>

<h4>How is eczema diagnosed?</h4>
	
	<p>Eczema is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination. There are no blood tests to make this diagnosis. The main features are a recurring or persistent, itchy rash involving typical body sites in a person with a family history of eczema, asthma or allergies. Patients with eczema will often have positive tests for allergies, but most of the allergens noted as positive by testing have no effect on the eczema.</p>

<h4>What is atopic skin like?</h4>

	<p>People with eczema have sensitive skin. Atopic skin tends to dry out easily, and is quickly irritated by soaps, excessive washing, extremes of temperature, and other irritating conditions, which will require attention to protect the skin. Fortunately, the severity seen mostly in infants and small children tends to decrease with age. Even when the skin apparently looks "clear", the tendency to "become irritated" persists.</p>

<h4>How should you care for skin with eczema?</h4>

	<p>Unfortunately, there are no cures for eczema. Fortunately, in most children eczema becomes less severe with time. The good news is eczema can be controlled. Treating eczema requires treating both skin dryness and skin inflammation. Aggressive and complete treatment of flares (Clearance Phase) and prevention of new flare-ups (Maintenance Phase) are critical to managing eczema. Both need equal attention and it is best to separate these as they are distinctly different.</p>

	<p><strong>Clearance Phase</strong> is intensive therapy for flares when the skin is itchy, red, swollen, oozing, and/or crusted and is interfering with daily function (e.g. school, sleep). The goal is to clear the skin and restore it to its normal appearance and function and decrease itch and discomfort. This nearly always requires the use of anti-inflammatory medications like topical steroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors, and the strict avoidance of all potential irritants and allergens that come into contact with the skin. Other treatments may include oral antihistamines, tar products, antibiotics for infection, and various anti-itch medications. This phase may last only a few days or several weeks. It is best to think of the clearance phase as throwing a large bucket of water on a fire to put the flames out, understanding the embers will remain behind and the flames will re ignite in the future. When the fire is extinguished more completely this will result in decreased flames (better symptom control) and possibly a longer period of time until the flames shoot up again (subsequent flare).</p>

	<p><strong>Maintenance Phase</strong> is entered into after achieving clearance. The skin is now restored to a more normal appearance (thick skin lines and darker or lighter color may persist) with decreased itch and/or discomfort. There is return to daily function (e.g. school, sleep). The use of anti-inflammatory medications like topical steroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors can be stopped or decreased significantly. During this phase the avoidance of all potential irritants and allergens that could come into contact with the skin should continue, especially when the patient has just completed the clearance phase. This phase should continue until the next flare when the clearance phase is restarted.</p>

	<p><strong>Bathing:</strong> as often as required to maintain hygiene and comfort.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Do NOT bath excessively (about 10 minutes, maximum 15 minutes) and relatively infrequently (once every 2-3 days)</li>
		<li>Baths should be <strong>warm</strong>, not hot</li>
		<li>Do use dilute bleach in the bath water if recommended (see <a href="bleach-baths.html">Bleach Bath</a>)</li>
		<li>Avoid the use of scrubbers, loofahs, and rough washcloths</li>
		<li>When the baby is withdrawn from the bath, <strong>pat dry</strong>, but don't rub with a towel. You want the skin to continue being moist</li>
		<li>Immediately after bathing, a moisturizer should be applied to the skin</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Body and facial soaps</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Do use cleansers such as: Dove Sensitive Skin Soap, Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser</li>
		<li>Do NOT use deodorant soaps (e.g. Dial, Zest, Irish Spring, Coast, Ivory) or soap that makes you feel "squeaky clean"</li>
		<li>Bubble bath, epsom salts, and some other bath additives should be <strong>avoided</strong>, because they can be irritating to the skin and worsen eczema</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Moisturizers:</strong> ointments and creams seal moisture from the bath into the skin, much like plastic wraps seal moisture into a cake (see <a href="skin.html">Skin</a>)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Moisturizers to be used regularly and liberally whenever the skin is dry (and always within 3 minutes after bathing); recommended FRAGRANCE-FREE moisturizers include: Vaseline, CeraVe Healing Ointment, Eucerin Cream, Vanicream, Moisturel Cream, Cetaphil Cream, CeraVe Cream, Theraplex Emollient, Nutraderm, Aquaphor, Hydrolatum</li>
		<li>They should be applied at least daily or multiple times per day to protect the skin and maintain hydration (should not see flakiness or white scale)</li>
		<li>Do NOT use lotions (they are watery and evaporate and are not as effective)</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Clothing and laundry detergents</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Do wear cotton or silk clothing</li>
		<li>Do NOT wear wool or polyester (prickly feeling) clothing</li>
		<li>Do NOT use harsh laundry detergents like Tide </li>
		<li>Do use mild detergents like All Free Clear Laundry detergent and Tide Free and Gentle</li>
		<li>Do NOT use fabric softeners or dryer antistatic sheets (e.g. Bounce, Cling Free Sheets)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Try a humidifier in the bedroom to help keep the skin from drying out.</p>
	
	<p>Sleeping in long sleeves and long-legged pajamas will help prevent scratching. Cotton gloves worn at night will also prevent scratching.</p>

	<p>Keep fingernails short. This prevents damage to the skin from scratching, which also helps prevent infection.</p>

	<p>Use sunscreen (SPF 15 or greater) when outdoors. Avoid getting sunburned.</p>

	<p>Swimming in chlorinated pools can cause much drying of the skin. After swimming in a pool with chlorine, rinse off under a warm shower and apply a moisturizer.</p>
