<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Eczema</h1>

<p>Specific triggers can vary based on the child and can include pets, carpet, dust mites, fabrics (such as wool), cigarette smoke, and scented products (such as perfume, laundry detergent, and air freshener).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are no cures for eczema. Fortunately, in most children eczema becomes less severe with time. The good news is eczema can be controlled. Treating eczema requires treating both skin dryness and skin inflammation.</p>

<p>A good bathing routine is necessary to treat skin dryness. Baths should be <strong>warm</strong>, not hot. They should be <strong>short</strong> in duration (about 10 minutes, maximum 15 minutes) and relatively infrequent (once every 2-3 days). The use of soap should be limited. Bubble bath, epsom salts, and some other bath additives should be <strong>avoided</strong>, because they can be irritating to the skin and worsen eczema. Also avoid the use of scrubbers, loofahs, and rough washcloths. When the baby is withdrawn from the bath, <strong>pat dry</strong>, but don't rub with a towel. You want the skin to continue being moist. Immediately after bathing, a moisturizer should be applied to the skin.</p>

<p>Moisturizers (e.g., Eucerin, Nutraderm, Cetaphil, Aquaphor, or Hydrolatum) should be applied <strong>at least twice daily</strong> in a thick layer. Generally two types of moisturizers are recommended for treating eczema: <strong>ointments and creams</strong>. Lotions are mostly water and are not recommended. It is most important to moisturize the skin immediately after bathing (within 3 minutes) to prevent evaporation of moisture from the skin. Ointments and creams seal moisture from the bath into the skin, much like plastic wraps seal moisture into a cake.</p>

<p>Try a humidifier in the bedroom to help keep the skin from drying out.</p>

<p>Sleeping in long sleeves and long legged pajamas will help prevent scratching.</p>
