<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Warts</h1>

<h2>What are warts?</h2>

	<p>Warts are caused by a virus that invades cells in the outer layer of the skin. The infected cells multiply very rapidly, resulting in the formation of a small bump on the skin. Warts appear skin-colored to white and feel rough on the surface. Sometimes, black dots are visible within the wart. These are the tiny blood vessels that feed the wart.</p>

<h2>How many kinds of warts are there?</h2>

	<p>There are several varieties: common hand warts, plantar (foot) warts, flat warts, and genital warts.</p>

	<p>Hand warts usually occur round the nails on the fingers, and the back of the hand, often in areas where the skin has been broken. This may occur with chronic fingernail biting or picking at hangnails.</p>

	<p>Plantar warts occur on the soles of the feet. Plantar warts do not stick up above the skin surface because the pressure of walking tends to flatten them.</p>

	<p>Flat warts are much smaller and less rough than hand and foot warts. In children, they are most common on the face, but can occur anywhere.</p>

	<p>Genital warts can be small, flat bumps or thin “tags” that protrude lightly from the skin. This type of wart occurs in the genital region and around the rectal (anal) and vaginal openings.</p>

<h2>How do you get warts?</h2>

	<p>Warts are probably passed on from person to person, but the time from initial contact to the time the wart grows large enough to be detected is so long that it would be difficult to trace the source of exposure. It is unclear whether warts may be caught from floors, school desks, towels and other objects. Patients should not be concerned about getting warts through every day activities.</p>

	<p>The reason that some people get warts and others do not is due to susceptibility, just as some people are ore susceptible to catching colds.</p>

<h2>Do children’s warts need to be treated?</h2>

	<p>In children, warts will eventually disappear over months to years without treatment. No bad consequences occur by leaving the warts alone. However, because warts spread to new locations on the child, are transmitted to others, and may cause cosmetic concern, most children preferred to be treated.</p>

<h2>How are warts treated?</h2>

	<p>The method of treatment varies. Standard treatment for adults is cryotherapy (freezing the wart). For young children, daily application of salicylic acid at home is used. This treatment is painless, but may take weeks for results to occur. With older children, cryotherapy in the doctor’s office may be used. A brief, stinging pain occurs using this method. Sometimes freezing will need to be repeated at 1-2 months intervals.</p>

	<p>For flat warts and genital warts, specific topical prescription medications are used, depending on the extent of these warts.</p>

	<h3>Do folk remedies work?</h3>

		<p>Many patients and doctors believe these methods can be effective. Especially in children, warts may go away on their own, so it is difficult to know if it was the remedy or the passage of time that led to the cure. Hypnosis and positive thinking may be appropriate approaches in some circumstances.</p>

	<h3>Treatment instructions</h3>

	<ol>

			<li>Salicylic acid plaster Mediplast: Cut out a piece that is the size of the wart, peel off paper backing and stick onto wart. Cover with duct-tape. Leave on for 24 hours and then repeat applications</li>
			<li>Retin A (tretinoin) and salicylic acid: First apply a dab of retin A onto wart. Rub in. Then apply salicylic acid to wart. Cover with duct-tape. Leave on for 24 hours and then repeat applications</li>
