<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Warts</h1>

<p>There are some home remedies you can try to remove warts on your hands/feet:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Soak while bathing (shower/bath) or place foot in warm water for 5 minutes. If you have a "candy thermometer" at home and choose to soak the hand or foot alone, the water can be as warm as 110 &deg;F for hands/feet (please confirm with thermometer), as many warts improve with hot water soaks. Make sure the water is not too hot to avoid a burn.</li>
		<li>Scrub: remove all dead dry skin from surface with an emery board (nail file) or pumice stone. Make sure this file/stone is labeled so it is only used on the wart, to avoid spreading virus.</li>
		<li>Apply medicine: select either Mediplast plaster (cut to size) or Wartstick, because these products contain salicylic acid 40%, which is stronger than other available products. Apply carefully to wart. If surrounding skin becomes irritated, please apply Vaseline to surrounding skin before applying the medicine to protect the surrounding skin.</li>
		<li>Cover with Band-aid or duct tape, and keep covered for 24 hours. This helps the medicine work and protects the skin.</li>
		<li>Repeat steps 1-4 every day for 2 weeks, then take a break for 1 week. Can repeat another 2 week cycle if needed.</li>
	</ol>
