<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Scabies</h1>

	<p>Scabies represents an infestation with mites that complete their life cycle on the body. When the diagnosis of scabies is made in one member of a household, <strong>everyone who lives in the house is treated and they are all treated at the same time</strong>. This is done to prevent reinfection. Itch may persist for a few weeks after the second treatment. Antihistamines (e.g. Zyrtec) may be taken to reduce the itch. Two forms of treatment are available: topical permethrin (Elimite) and oral ivermectin.</p>

	<h3>Treatment</h3>
	<p>For topical therapy, the cream must be applied to "every square inch" of the body, including between fingers and toes, in the axillae (armpits) and groin, between the buttocks and under the nails. It is recommended that the nails be cut back to avoid persistent infection in this area. The cream is applied in the evening and washed off in the shower or bath in the morning.</p>

	<p>Oral ivermectin is not FDA-approved for scabies and represents an off-label use. However, it has been used for decades to treat parasitic infections. The dose is 200 micrograms/kilogram and it is taken <strong><u>once</u> weekly</strong> for two weeks. In other words, the second oral dose of ivermectin is taken one week after the first dose. Pregnant women should NOT take ivermectin. If any children are to receive this medication, they must first consult their pediatrician.</p>

	<p>Regardless of which treatment is used, <strong>everyone who lives in the house should be treated at the same time</strong>.</p>

	<p>All bedding (including sheets and mattress covers) should be washed in hot water and then dried with the dryer set on high/hot. This whole process is repeated one week later (including application of cream to everyone in the household and washing and drying of bedding).</p>

	<p>Clothes worn during the week between the two treatments should be washed and dried (as outlined above), both before wearing and after wearing. Any clothing or stuffed animals/toys that con not be washed and dried (hot) should be either put in a garbage bag and sealed for a least one week or placed in a closed closet for at least one week.</p>
