<p>Your baby knows familiar voices at birth! <strong>Singing</strong> can help calm your baby and listening to the rhythms and patterns in songs is a wonderful way to build your baby’s language skills.</p>

<p>Use <strong>Parentese</strong> - a sing-song, high-pitched voice with exaggerated expressions – when you talk with your baby. Babies love this type of voice and talking to them throughout the day is great for language development!</p>

<p>If you’re feeling <strong>sad or anxious</strong>, tell your doctor about it. You are not alone and we can help. Please let us know if you or your loved ones have any concerns about your mood.</p>

<p><strong>Snuggle</strong> your baby! Touch is an important way for you to bond. Showing love and happiness to your baby helps build their brain and lets them know they are safe and loved.</p>

<p>Try and figure out what your baby is trying to tell you! By learning their different cries and faces, you know your baby best and what she likes or needs.</p>
