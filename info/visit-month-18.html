<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">18 Month Visit</h1>

<p>Let your child be "the boss" at playtime. Join in their games and try not to tell them what to play with or how to use something they are exploring. Kids learn best when they follow their own interests.</p>

<p>Tell your child what <u>to</u> do, instead of what <u>not</u> to do. Saying "please walk" works better than "don't run," because it teaches your child how you want them to behave. Use clear instructions and praise your child when they do what you ask. Save "no" and "don't" for <strong>safety</strong> issues.</p>

<p>Having regular routines can help to avoid <strong>tantrums</strong>! Planning what the day will look like and talking to your toddler about it can make it easier for them to control their behavior and prepare for what comes next.</p>

<p>Comfort and distract your child when he or she is upset or has a tantrum. They are too young to understand what they did wrong and need your help to calm down.</p>

<p>Count things throughout the day&mdash;like crackers, socks, hands, or toes! Introducing numbers in a real-life way is important to build math skills for kindergarten.</p>

<h3>Cognitive Development</h3>

	<p>Your toddler's vocabulary will grow by leaps and bounds over the coming months. While the first single words are usually nouns ("cat", "ball", "bottle"), phrases that use nouns and verbs tend to follow within a few months of first words: "Me want", "Go bye-bye".</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Continue to encourage language development with constant labeling, pointing, and narrating simple tasks throughout the day.</li>
		<li>Make reading books more interactive with flaps, textures, tabs. Simple language with short phrases, rhymes, and repetition are ideal. Make book/reading time a standard part of a bedtime/nap routine.</li>
		<li>Offer simple choices with 2 objects and encourage the child to point or verbally express their preference.</li>
		<li>See speech therapy for more recommendations.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>To facilitate cognitive skills, offer opportunities for puzzles, shape sorters, matching, and sorting tasks. Offer pretend play toys such as dress up, cars, babies, play kitchen. Toddlers can hold a clear memory of an object in their mind long after it's out of sight. Take advantage of this new capability by playing hide and seek with a favorite toy.</p>

	<p>Continue to offer normal developmental stimulation opportunities through participation in play groups for socialization, trips to the playground, music groups, story time at the library.</p>

<h3>Fine Motor Development</h3>
	
	<p>Offer activities such as coloring with different utensils: markers, crayons, chalk. Offer manipulative types of toys including shape sorters, duplo legos, magnets, chubby crayons, large, chunky puzzles with knobs, stacking toys, blocks, and toys that have “tools”&mdash;i.e., wooden hammer sets, fill and dump, etc. Encourage using both hands, stacking, scribbling, and pulling apart/putting back together.</p>

	<p>Invest in a small desk or table and chairs to dedicate to small motor activities, such as puzzles, peg boards, blocks, and arts/crafts. Having a dedicated space will signal quiet, seated time and will also help your child to focus on the activity. Present one toy or activity at a time and demonstrate multiple ways of playing with the same toy to help foster attention and creative thinking.</p>

	<p>Do lots of different puzzles, such as the ones with large handles on them. Practice putting small objects into containers so your child has to be accurate. E.g. put beans or cheerios into a water bottle or coins into a piggy bank. Watch your child carefully so s/he doesn't put the beans or coins in the mouth. This helps her/him learn to use the hands accurately.</p>

<h3>Gross Motor Development</h3>

	<p>Encourage barefoot walking and invest in pre-walker shoes with a solid but flexible sole. While standing with support, place toys on the floor to encourage squatting and sitting down with control while strengthening the hips/legs. Spending time in a kneeling position will also help with improved stability in the trunk. Give your child obstacle courses to go through, such as over a pile of pillows and under a tunnel. Practice going up and downstairs. Throw and kick balls! Visit indoor gyms for novel climbing structures and equipment or try swimming.</p>

	<p>There may be days when your child's physical energy is more than you can handle. Rather than fight it, turn on some music, grab your little one, and invent some new dance steps together. Other good ideas are playing tag, ring around the rosie, hide and go seek, and blowing bubbles and running after them.</p>
