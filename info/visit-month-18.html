<p>Let your child be "the boss" at playtime. Join in their games and try not to tell them what to play with or how to use something they are exploring. Kids learn best when they follow their own interests.</p>

<p>Tell your child what <u>to</u> do, instead of what <u>not</u> to do. Saying "please walk" works better than "don't run," because it teaches your child how you want them to behave. Use clear instructions and praise your child when they do what you ask. Save "no" and "don't" for <strong>safety</strong> issues.</p>

<p>Having regular routines can help to avoid <strong>tantrums</strong>! Planning what the day will look like and talking to your toddler about it can make it easier for them to control their behavior and prepare for what comes next.</p>

<p>Comfort and distract your child when he or she is upset or has a tantrum. They are too young to understand what they did wrong and need your help to calm down.</p>

<p>Count things throughout the day&mdash;like crackers, socks, hands, or toes! Introducing numbers in a real-life way is important to build math skills for kindergarten.</p>
