<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Cholesterol & Triglycerides</h1>

	<h2>What are triglycerides?</h2>
		<p>Triglycerides are an important part of your cholesterol (or "lipid") profile. Your body stores fat from the foods you eat in the form of triglycerides. You need some triglycerides for energy and good health. However, when the levels of triglycerides in your blood get too high, they contribute to heart disease.</p>

	<h2>What is a healthy triglyceride number?</h2>
		<p>A normal triglyceride level is less than 150 mg/dl.</p>

		<p>High triglycerides (greater than 150) and low HDLs (less than 40 for men; less than 45 for women) often show up together. This combination may increase the risk of heart disease.</p>

	<h2>How can I decrease my high triglycerides?</h2>
		<p>Changing your diet will help the most. Staying at a healthy weight and exercising regularly can also be helpful in lowering your triglyceride levels.</p>

		<h3>Eat more plant foods!</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Add vegetables and fruits</strong><br />
			Vegetables and fruits are packed with nutrients&mdash;like vitamins, minerals, and fiber&mdash;that help your body stay healthy and prevent disease. Choose fresh, frozen, or canned varieties (make sure canned don't have added sodium, fat, or sugar).</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Eat as many non-starchy vegetables as you would like each day.</li>
				<li>Limit fruit and starchy vegetables to no more than 2 servings per day.<br />
					<em>Examples: corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash</em></li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Choose high-fiber foods</strong><br />
			Foods high in fiber will help to lower your triglycerides and LDL ("bad") cholesterol.<br />
			<em>Examples: legumes, whole grains, ground flaxseed, oat bran, vegetables, and fruit</em></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Note: Drink more water when you increase your fiber intake. Also, add fiber to your diet slowly to prevent intestinal discomfort.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Decrease foods with refined carbohydrates</strong><br />
			Refined carbohydrates include sugars and processed grains. These can raise triglycerides in certain people.<br />
			<em>Examples: white flour, white rice, white bread, pasta, sweets, and sodas</em></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Note: Choose foods that contain whole grains, like 7-grain breads, whole-wheat pasta, and brown rice.</li>
				<li>Also, consider whole grains with a high-fiber content, such as quinoa, barley, oats, and millet.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Eat more good fats and fewer bad fats</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Avoid saturated fats and fried foods</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Stay away from fried food and fats that are solid at room temperature.<br />
				<em>Examples: high-fat meats, sauces, and spreads (like butter and margarine)</em></li>
				<li>Instead, use mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fats.<br />
				<em>Examples: Olive oil and flaxseed oil are best for salads. Canola oil, safflower oil, nut and seed oils, and grapeseed oil are good for cooking.</em></li>
				<li>Remove skin from poultry and trim the fat off red meat.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Avoid trans fatty acids and hidden fats</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Read food labels. The nutrition label on every packaged food lists "Total Fat" (per serving). Unhealthy fats (saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol) are listed just below that. Healthy fats may or may not be listed.</li>
				<li>Avoid foods with "trans fats" on the nutrition label. Also avoid any food with "partially hydrogenated vegetable oil" in the ingredients.<br />
				<em>Examples: fried food, fatty snack foods, and packaged baked goods like cake, pie, biscuits, frozen pizza, crackers, margarine</em></li>
				<li>Avoid high-fat foods.<br />
				<em>Examples: fried food, fatty meat, lunchmeats, hot dogs, fatty snack foods like packaged baked goods, and whole milk dairy products like ice cream, cheese, butter</em></li>
			</ul>
			<li>Choose foods high in Omega-3 fatty acids (healthy fats)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Omega-3s are a type of poly-unsaturated fat and they are low in saturated fat.<br />
				<em>Examples: ground flax seed, flaxseed oil, soy products, legumes, walnuts, and dark green, leafy vegetables</em></li>
				<li>The American Heart Association recommends eating at least 2 servings of oily fish each week.<br />
				<em>Examples: salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna, and trout</em></li>
			</ul>
			<li>Replace red meat with lower-fat sources of protein</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Vegetable proteins are excellent foods to improve your health and will have a direct effect on lowering your cholesterol.<br />
				<em>Examples of vegetable protein: beans (legumes), peas, and soy products</em><br />
				<em>Examples of animal protein: fish; white poultry (turkey or chicken) prepared without the skin</em></li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<h3>Decrease or eliminate alcohol</h3>
		<p>Drinking alcohol is a strong contributor to high triglyceride levels. For some, even a small amount of alcohol can elevate triglycerides. The type of alcohol doesn't seem to matter&mdash;beer, wine, or mixed drinks all have the same effect.</p>

		<h3>Decrease or eliminate sugar and sweets</h3>
		<p>Sugar in all of its forms will quickly raise triglycerides in many people. Foods that are high in simple sugars enter your blood stream fast and can raise triglycerides.<br />
		<em>Examples of sugar: white sugar, brown sugar, high fructose corn syrup, honey, maple syrup, molasses, sucrose, and many more</em><br />
		<em>Examples of sweets: soda, fruit juices, candy, cookies, ice cream, pies, pastries, and many others</em></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Beware! In many low-fat packaged foods, sugar (sometime, lots of it) has been added to improve the taste. Read labels!</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Good habits to help you lower your triglycerides</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight</strong><br />
			You and your health care provider can decide on a weight that is healthy you. Even a small weight loss can make a big difference in reducing your triglycerides, cholesterol, and risk for heart disease. Ask for a referral to a nutritionist to help you lose weight healthfully.</li>
			<li><strong>Exercise regularly</strong><br />
			Exercise will use excess triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol. Exercise has many other benefits, like helping to keep weight off. For people with diabetes, it can help control blood sugar.</li>
