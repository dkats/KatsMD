<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Sleep</h1>

One particular source I'd like to recommend is <a href="https://drcraigcanapari.com/" target="_blank">Craig Canapari, MD</a>, who is a pediatric sleep doctor and Director of the Yale Pediatric Sleep Center. His website is full of great information about everything sleep-related: the basics, sleep training little kids, and sleep in teenagers.

<h2>General</h2>

	<p>Here are the general recommendations for how much sleep children need:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis</li>
		<li>Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis</li>
		<li>Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis</li>
		<li>Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis</li>
		<li>Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Good sleep habits (sometimes referred to as "sleep hygiene") can help you get a good night’s sleep. Some habits that can improve your sleep health:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Be consistent. Go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning, including on the weekends</li>
		<li>Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature</li>
		<li>Remove electronic devices, such as TVs, computers, and smart phones, from the bedroom</li>
		<li>Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime</li>
		<li>Get some exercise. Being physically active during the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Safe Sleep</h2>

	<p>Safe sleep is important to minimize the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</p>

	<p>Babies should always be put to sleep flat on their backs, until they are 1 year old. Babies placed to sleep on their stomachs are at very high risk for SIDS. If your baby rolls over <u>on his/her own</u> from back to stomach or stomach to back, it is ok. Your baby will be safe in positions that they are able to move to, as long as they always start on their backs.</p>
	
	<p>Never put your baby to sleep on soft surfaces, such as on a couch, sofa, waterbed, pillow, quilt, sheepskin, or blanket. These surfaces can be very dangerous for babies, because they trap the baby and keep them from keeping their mouths/noses open to the air. Do not use a car seat, stroller, swing, infant carrier, infant sling, or similar products as your baby's regular sleep area.</p>

	<p>Room sharing reduces the risk of SIDS. Your baby should not sleep in an adult bed, on a couch, or on a chair alone, with you, or with anyone else, including siblings or pets. Having a separate safe sleep surface for the baby reduces the risk of SIDS and the chance of suffocation, strangulation, and entrapment. If you bring your baby into your bed for feeding or comforting, remove all soft items and bedding from the area. When finished, put your baby back in a separate sleep area made for infants, like a crib or bassinet, and close to your bed.</p>

	<p>Couches and armchairs can also be very dangerous for babies; if adults fall asleep as they feed, comfort, or bond with the baby while on these surfaces, the baby can fall off. Parents and other caregivers should be mindful of how tired they are whenever holding the baby.</p>

<h2>Sleep Training/Sleep Problems in Infants</h2>

	<p><strong>Infant sleep training guidelines can be used at 5-6 months of age</strong>. Keep in mind that it is normal for things to worsen in the first night or two, but they will get better. Remember: consistency is the key to success.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Continue to disassociate feeding with sleeping. If your baby needs to eat, do this in another room (not the baby's bedroom) and make sure the baby does not fall asleep while feeding. Ideally, switch to bottles at night and have father/non-nursing partner give night feeds.</li>
		<li>Consolidate the sleep routine to include a consistent repertoire that anyone can replicate. Books, sleep sac (at naps, as well as bedtime), and singing the same sleepsong. Try to keep this part of the routine to 20-30 minutes at most.</li>
		<li>Put your baby to bed tired, but awake. It is essential for the baby to learn to fall asleep independently in crib.</li>
		<li>Go in once to reassure that you have not left and say "I love you. Good night." Repeated visits can make babies more upset, but you can go in more than once if you want to. The key is to offer as little intervention as possible and refrain from picking them up.</li>
		<li>When your baby wakes up again, go in once to reassure, and leave as soon as possible.</li>
		<li>Make sure the room is dark and free of too much stimulation to help reinforce the idea that the bedroom is for sleeping.</li>
		<li>Consider helping your baby attach to a "lovie."</li>
		<li>Watch for early signs of being tired. Sleep begets sleep. If your baby is overtired, this process is harder since the baby will fight sleep more. If your baby cries through an entire nap cycle, keep them up for an hour and try again.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Most babies sleep 10-12 hours at night and take 2-3 naps during the day. I expect your baby will become a deeper sleeper and have a more consolidated sleep pattern once they learn to fall asleep independently. This process should take 5-7 days if done consistently.</p>

<h2>Sleep Regression</h2>

	<h3>What is sleep regression?</h3>
	
		<p>Sleep regression is a period of time, usually about two to four weeks, when a baby who's sleeping well suddenly has trouble settling down for sleep or wakes up fussing in the middle of the night.</p>

	<h3>What causes sleep regression in babies and why does it happen? </h3>
		
		<p>A number of factors can cause a baby discomfort or make her anxious or restless, leading to sleep regression, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A growth spurt, which makes babies extra-hungry</li>
			<li>Teething pain</li>
			<li>Reaching a new (exciting!) developmental milestone</li>
			<li>Disruptions in routines, like starting day care</li>
			<li>Traveling, which inevitably involves sleeping in a new environment</li>
			<li>An illness, such as a cold or an ear infection </li>
		</ul>

	<h3>How long does sleep regression last?</h3>
		
		<p>Baby sleep regressions usually last about two to four weeks&mdash;the time for your little one to get used to a new routine or milestone or to recover from an illness&mdash;although the exact duration depends on the cause and can vary from baby to baby.</p>

		<p>In the meantime, stick to your routines and consider testing a sleep training method if necessary.</p>

	<h3>Signs of sleep regression</h3>
	
		<p>The signs of sleep regression can vary based on the cause of your baby's sleep problems. Here are some signs your baby may be going through a sleep regression:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>More frequent night waking</li>
			<li>Trouble falling asleep at bedtime</li>
			<li>Increased fussiness or crankiness</li>
			<li>Suddenly resisting naps</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h3>When sleep regressions happen</h3>
		
		<p>Sleep regression can happen at any time, since it's linked to unpredictable factors like disruptions in routines or an illness.</p>
	
		<p>But there are a few periods when sleep regression is relatively foreseeable, due to growth spurts, teething or reaching new milestones:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>3 to 4 months:</strong> The dreaded 4-month sleep regression is often the hardest for parents simply because it's the first. There are several culprits behind baby sleep problems at this age: the pain caused by teething, hunger linked to growth spurts and the excitement of rolling over for the first time.</li>
			<li><strong>6 months:</strong> Babies often go through another growth spurt at about 6 months old. By this age, however, little ones are capable of sleeping through the night and may wake simply for snuggles&mdash;which means it might be time for testing a sleep training method.</li>
			<li><strong>8 to 10 months:</strong> Many babies begin crawling when they're around 9 months old (although some start sooner and others later) and begin standing at around 10 months. Separation anxiety is also common (and perfectly normal) around this age, which may cause your baby to wake up looking for reassurance from you during the night.</li>
			<li><strong>12 months:</strong> Sometime between 9 to 12 months, babies start standing up. At around the one-year mark, others take their first steps (although the average age is 14 months, with some babies starting earlier and others waiting until the 18-month mark). Reaching big milestones can cause temporary sleep problems.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p>Toddlers also often go through sleep regressions at around 18 months and 24 months that may be caused by nightmares and night terrors, fear of the dark, toddler teething, and separation anxiety.</p>

	<h3>Tips for managing sleep regressions in your baby</h3>
	
		<p>Fortunately, sleep regression is usually temporary. Follow these tips to manage sleep regression in your baby:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Get to know and watch out for your baby's sleep cues (like rubbing her eyes, fussiness, yawning, looking away), so you can get them to bed before they're overtired&mdash;which makes it harder for them to fall and stay asleep.</li>
			<li>Stick to a consistent bedtime routine; think dinner, bath, book, lullabies, and a few comforting words.</li>
			<li>Ensure your baby is getting enough sleep during the day, as overtired babies are more likely to have problems sleeping at night.</li>
			<li>If your baby suddenly starts crying in the middle of the night, give them a few minutes to fuss before you respond; they may self-soothe back to sleep. If they don't, enter the room to check that everything's okay, pat them on the head or tummy, quietly say a reassuring word, and leave. Try to avoid rocking, cuddling, or feeding your baby, as this may encourage them to regularly wake for your attention. If they keep crying, you may want to say a few comforting words from the door and leave them again, repeating as necessary at increasing intervals of time.</li>
			<li>Consider trying (or retrying) sleep training if your baby is at least 4 to 6 months old. Give it at least two weeks to see if it's working.</li>
			<li>If your baby seems stressed out by a life change or has separation anxiety, giving them extra attention during the day and especially before bedtime can help them to feel more secure at night.</li>
		</ul>

<h2>Sleep Problems in Toddlers and Young Kids</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>If climbing out, take the crib and other dangerous items out of room for safety. Keep the toddler bed for sleeping without a lot of stuffed animals or distractions.</li>
		<li>Consider using a lovie or other attachment item to help self-soothe when your child is tired or upset.</li>
		<li>Create a simple, short bedtime routine that can be used both at bedtime and naptime. For example-bath, brush teeth, books, sleep song, and into bed. Disassociate feeding from sleeping.</li>
		<li>If your child is overtired, start routines earlier to help reset their clock. Bedtime at 6:30pm, naptime at 12:30pm.</li>
		<li>If your child isn't tired yet, move bedtime to the time they actually are falling asleep (or 30-60 min later). Once your child is falling asleep on their own, move the bedtime earlier by 15 minutes every other day until you get to the desired bedtime and/or you get resistance. This is called <strong>bedtime fading</strong>.</li>
		<li>Eliminate rocking to sleep. Go in once if your child is crying to reassure them: "I love you, good bye, and good night." If you need to go in again, keep it short and simple. Alternately, you could stay in the room until your child falls asleep, but make sure to gradually decrease the support over time. You are teaching your child how to fall asleep on their own.</li>
		<li>Consistency is key in re-establishing good sleep patterns.</li>

<h2>Sleep Problems in Older Kids</h2>

	<p>A major barrier for older kids getting high quality is what we call "sleep hygiene".</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Watching TV or working on the computer:</strong> Turn off screens an hour before bedtime and don't use them while in bed. The bright light tells our brains that it's time to be awake and keeps us from getting sleepy.</li>
		<li><strong>Drinking alcoholic or caffeinated drinks at night:</strong> Don't drink either for at least 3 hours before going to bed.</li>
		<li><strong>Taking medicines late at night:</strong> Many prescription and nonprescription medicines can delay or disrupt sleep. If you take any on a regular basis, check with your doctor about the best time to take them.</li>
		<li><strong>Big meals late at night:</strong> Not ideal, especially if you are prone to indigestion or heartburn. Allow at least 3 hours between dinner and going to bed.</li>
		<li><strong>Smoking at night:</strong> Don't smoke for at least 3 hours before going to bed. (Better yet: quit!)</li>
		<li><strong>Lack of exercise:</strong> Just do it! Regular exercise promotes healthy sleep.</li>
		<li><strong>Exercise late at night:</strong> A no-no. Allow at least 4 hours between exercise and going to bed. It revs up your metabolism, making falling asleep harder.</li>
		<li><strong>Busy or stressful activities late at night:</strong> Another no-no. Stop working or doing strenuous house work at least 2 hours before going to bed. The best preparation for a good night's rest is unwinding and relaxing.</li>
		<li><strong>Varying bedtimes:</strong> Going to sleep at widely varying bed times&mdash;10pm one night and 1am the next&mdash;disrupts optimal sleep. The best practice is to go to sleep at around the same time every night, even on the weekends.</li>
		<li><strong>Varying wake-up times:</strong> Likewise, the best practice is to wake up around the same time every day (with not more than an hour's difference on the weekends).</li>
		<li><strong>Spending too much time in bed, tossing and turning:</strong> Solving insomnia by spending too much time in bed is usually counter-productive; you'll become only more frustrated. Don't stay in bed if you are awake, tossing and turning. Get up and do something else until you are ready to go to sleep.</li>
		<li><strong>Late day napping:</strong> Naps can be wonderful but should not be taken after 3pm. This can disrupt your ability to get to sleep at night.</li>
		<li><strong>Poor sleep environment:</strong> Noisy, too hot, uncomfortable bed, not dark enough, not the right covers or pillow&mdash;all these can prevent a good night's sleep.</li>
