<p>Use clear language when asking your child to do something. Explaining why and how, like "don't run into the street because the cars can't see you" also helps your child understand how to behave throughout the day.</p>

<p>Help your child use their <strong>imagination</strong> during difficult moments. You can ask them to imagine being a superhero or imagine themselves in a favorite place or doing a special activity. Teaching them how to do this will help them handle challenges and calm down in the future.</p>

<p>Give lots of <strong>positive attention</strong> to your child when they are behaving well. They want your attention and if they get it by behaving well, they will do it more and more. Your approval is so important to them and makes a huge difference in their development.</p>

<p><strong>Taking turns</strong> is much easier than sharing! Model for your child how to take turns and ask for a turn when they want one.</p>

<p>Your child is learning that different people have different thoughts and feelings. You can play the "Whatâ€™s the feeling" game to practice.</p>
