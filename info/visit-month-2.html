<p>Tell family members to <strong>talk</strong> to your baby in whatever language they feel most comfortable using. Having more than one language in the home can be an advantage for kids!</p>

<p>Try and figure out what helps your baby to calm down – like gentle rocking, singing or shushing. Knowing what your baby likes will help you the next time they’re upset.</p>

<p>As much as possible, try and stay calm around your baby. It can help to take long, deep breaths. They look to you to tell them how to react and feel, and when you’re calm, they will learn how to be calm too.</p>

<p>Respond to the cooing sounds your baby makes. Turn each coo into a <strong>conversation</strong> by repeating their sounds and adding new ones. These are called "ping-pong" conversations and help your baby learn language.</p>

<p>Do <strong>tummy time</strong> many times each day. It's never too early to try, but only do tummy time while supervising your baby.</p>
