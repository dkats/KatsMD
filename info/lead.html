<h3>How to reduce lead exposure</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Regularly wash childrenâ€™s hands and toys. Hands and toys can become contaminated from household dust or exterior soil.</li>
		<li>Regularly wet-mop floors and wet-wipe window components. Because household dust is a major source of lead, you should wet-mop floors and wet-wipe horizontal surfaces every 2-3 weeks. Windowsills and wells can contain high levels of leaded dust. If feasible, windows should be shut to prevent abrasion of painted surfaces or opened from the top sash.</li>
		<li>Take off shoes when entering the house to prevent bringing lead-contaminated soil in from outside.</li>
		<li>Prevent children from playing in bare soil; if possible, provide them with sandboxes. Plant grass on areas of bare soil or cover the soil with grass seed, mulch, or wood chips, if possible. Until the bare soil is covered, move play areas away from bare soil and away from the sides of the house. If you have a sandbox, cover the box when not in use to prevent cats from using it as a litter box. That will help protect children from exposure to animal waste.</li>
		<li>Reduce occupational take-home exposure by changing out of work clothes and shoes before going home.</li>
		<li>Run tap water to cold temperature before drinking or cooking with it.</li>
		<li>Place duct tape or contact paper over chipping paint; keep windows closed if peeling paint or nearby renovations.</li>
		<li>Find alternative housing for children during renovation (homes built before 1978 may have lead paint).</li>
