<h2>Under Age 3</h2>

	<p>A minimum of 20-25 hours of active engagement in comprehensive intervention is needed to support development of social communication skills, language skills, play skills, and decrease maladaptive behavior. This should be provided through Early Intervention and/or school department and home-based services. Services should be given 12 months per year, in systematically planned and developmentally appropriate educational activities designed to address identified objectives.</p>

	<p>ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) services, in particular, are strongly recommended as an evidence-based strategy to encourage developmental skill acquisition.</p>

	<p>Prior to the age of three, children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) receive services through Early Intervention services. These services should include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Behavioral Therapy (ABA, Discrete Trial Training, or DIR/Floortime approach)</li>
		<li>Developmental specialist consultation</li>
		<li>Occupational Therapy for fine motor, visual motor, and/or sensory concerns</li>
		<li>Physical Therapy for gross motor concerns</li>
		<li>Intensive Speech and Language interventions to support communicative competence</li>
		<li>Social Communication playgroups to encourage interaction with peers in a structured and supportive environment, with 1:1 adult support</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Home-based services provided through EI and Schools are needed in order to generalize skills across settings and address specific behavioral needs in the home and community. Goals address the concerns of the family and offer opportunities for their active participation.</p>
	 
	<p>Additional ABA through health insurance should also be provided in the home, with consultation to the school and/or child care settings in order to ensure consistency of teaching methods and carryover of skills across settings.</p>

	<p>Parents are encouraged to look into Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for their child with special needs. For more information: (<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/disability/Factsheet-CHLD.pdf">http://www.ssa.gov/disability/Factsheet-CHLD.pdf</a>).</p>

	<p>Children with Autism may also qualify for additional health insurance (MassHealth) to help pay for autism treatments. Please contact the Autism Insurance Resource Center Telephone: 781-642-0248 or 800-642-0249; <a href="mailto:info@disabilityinfo.org">info@disabilityinfo.org</a>; <a href="http://www.disabilityinfo.org/arica/">http://www.disabilityinfo.org/arica/</a>) for more information.</p>

	<p>A number of valuable Toolkits & Resources can be found and downloaded from the <a href="www.autismspeaks.org/family-services/toolkits">Autism Speaks website.</a></p>

	<p>It is essential that all professionals and paraprofessionals working with your child maintain open communication among themselves and with his parents and his teachers. Techniques should be uniform across all settings, including home, school, and therapeutic environments to insure maximum gain of function.</p>

<h2>Starting Preschool</h2>

	<p>At the age of three, children transition from Early Intervention to receive services through their local school department.</p>

	<p>The town's special education department should be contacted 3-6 months before turning three to start the evaluation process for preschool.</p>

	<p>Important components of the school program include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Formulation of IEP</strong>, with specific, measurable, and sufficiently challenging goals based on consultation with multidisciplinary staff including: Special Educator, Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), School psychologist, Speech-language therapist, Occupational therapist, and Physical Therapist.</li>
		<li>Ongoing <strong>measurement and documentation of the individual child’s progress</strong> toward educational objectives, resulting in adjustments in programming when indicated.</li>
		<li>Placement in a <strong>classroom with a high teacher to student ratio</strong>, staffed by professionals with experience in working with children with ASD.</li>
		<li>Structured setting with 1:1 instructional aide support, working towards goals set by BCBA, based on a functional behavioral assessment. </li>
		<li>Support from special educator to reach academic goals.</li>
		<li>Opportunities for <strong>supported interactions with typically developing peers</strong> who can act as social role models.</li>
		<li>Visual supports within the classroom including the use of a picture schedule, now-then boards and the pairing of verbal language with visual cues.</li>
		<li><strong>Occupational therapy consultation</strong> for the development of a sensory diet to be instituted within the classroom as well as for development of fine motor goals.</li>
		<li>Intensive <strong>Speech and Language interventions</strong> to support communicative competence including the use of sign language, Picture Exchange Communication Systems (PECS), the Hanen program (More than Words and Talkability),and oral language. An Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) evaluation may be needed in order to identify the best ways for your child to communicate.</li>
		<li>Support for development of <strong>functional adaptive skills</strong> to support increasing responsibility and independence.</li>
		<li><strong>Social skills</strong> interventions specifically targeting deficits in social communication should be provided, using an established curriculum.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are some great resources that aim to help parents understand their rights and responsibilities when it comes to IEP development.</p>
