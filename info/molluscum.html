<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Molluscum Contagiosum</h1>

<p>Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection of the skin that causes smooth-surfaced, firm, small (1 to 6 mm), dome-shaped bumps that can be white, pink or skin-colored. They usually appear on the face, trunk, arms, and legs, especially in the folds. The infection may be spread to others by close (skin to skin) contact (such as occurs with bathing and public swimming pools), sharing towels and clothing. The bumps usually disappear without treatment in 18 months, but can be shorter or longer. They can be treated to decrease symptoms or decrease spreading them.</p>

<p>At least one-third of patients with molluscum contagiosum develop some associated skin inflammation. This may take the form of swollen red bumps at the site of the molluscum contagiosum, eczema surrounding the individual molluscum contagiosum lesions and/or small itchy bumps on other unaffected areas.</p>

<p>Scraping (curetting), extracting the middle part (central plug) of the bump with a needle, application of liquid nitrogen (very cold liquid), application of cantharidin (a topical blistering agent), and injection of skin test antigens (to stimulate the immune system to enhance the body's molluscum fighting ability) are ways to help the infection resolve faster. Often multiple treatments are required to remove all the molluscum contagiosum.</p>

<p>Recommendations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Limit scratching the bumps. This may spread the infection to other parts of the body and possibly to other people.</li>
		<li>Avoid close skin to skin contact with others until the bumps disappear.</li>
		<li>Do not share towels or clothing.</li>
		<li>You should seek immediate medical attention if you develop swelling, redness, pain, tenderness, or warmth in the areas of the bumps. They may be infected.</li>
		<li>Because molluscum infections take many months to go away and so many children have this common infection (about 5-7 percent of young children) exclusion from routine activities are not recommended.</li>
	</ul>
