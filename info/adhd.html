<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">ADHD</h1>

<p>Children with ADHD require consistent routine, structure and behavioral expectations both at home and at school. It is important that all caregivers involved in their care are consistent in providing the same behavioral management. The following are a few examples of behavioral modifications parents might consider implementing at home:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Have the same basic routine every day and provide a schedule that includes meals, homework, playtime, and bedtime. The schedule should be in place for the child to see, and any changes should be made as far as in advance as possible. This allows the child a way to know what to expect from the parents at home.</li>
	<li>Children with ADHD need clear and consistent rules that they can understand and follow. This allows them to know exactly what is expected from him/her.</li>
	<li>Reward the child for following the rules. Recognize even small good behavior and praise it. Praise is a powerful reward, especially when it comes from parents.</li>
	<li>Help the child by structuring situations. Break a large task that the child seems to have difficulty performing into simple steps and praise him/her at the completion of each small step.</li>
	<li>In general, children with ADHD will benefit from more frequent and immediate feedback that is either a reward, such as praise, or a consequence, which may be a punishment.</li>
	<li>A child with ADHD may require more supervision and support while being asked to perform tasks that are unfulfilling or tiresome, which may be how homework is perceived.</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage parents to share a copy of our report with their child's school department. Children with ADHD may be considered for eligibility for an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) under the category of other health impaired or for a section 504 Accommodation Plan, in order to provide them with classroom accommodations. These accommodations may include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide preferential seating, closer to the teacher and away from any distractions such as windows, doors or disruptive peers.</li>
	<li>Have the teacher maintain eye-contact when giving instructions or classroom materials to ensure proper attention. Have the child repeat out loud the information in order to ensure that the child heard and understood the proper instructions.</li>
	<li>Have the teacher check frequently with the child to make sure he/she is still on task and develop a private cue to bring him/her back to task if noticeably distracted. They may also benefit from verbal reminders to calm their body.</li>
	<li>Break the work into smaller components to keep from becoming overwhelmed and provide extra time to complete assignments, including untimed testing. Provide the child with a quiet space to complete testing.</li>
	<li>Provide both oral and written instructions.</li>
	<li>Simplify and repeat complex directions.</li>
	<li>Require high quality work while reducing quantity of work. </li>
	<li>Reduce or shorten assignments.</li>
	<li>Using organizational strategies, such as lists, charts and diagrams, as well as homework log books, will also be central in order to address organizational weaknesses. Children with ADHD will also benefit from the use of a written/visual schedule to help anticipate and prepare for transitions and changes in his/her routine. In particular, for less frequently occurring events such as field trips or assembly, teachers can use the schedule to review behavioral expectations for the event.</li>
	<li>Children with ADHD will benefit from behavioral modification strategies, including the use of praise, planned ignoring, effective commands, consistent rules, use of contingent rewards/reinforcers, and a taking space plan. For example, ignore mild restless behavior such as standing instead of sitting when the behavior is not disruptive to other students; then use increased attention and praise when the child returns to sitting. It will also be important to catch him/her being good and reinforce attempts to maintain attention and follow rules or directions.</li>
	<li>Children with ADHD may benefit from some accommodations related to the need for physical movement. These include:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>use of a sensory diet and planned sensory breaks throughout the day to help refocus to task</li>
		<li>interspersing high and low interest activities throughout the day rather than attempting to complete all seat work in a long block of time</li>
		<li>being allowed to stand within a certain range of his chair or being allowed a sensory cushion</li>
		<li>movement breaks</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Maintaining frequent communication between parents and teacher, perhaps with a log book that goes with the child to school each day and returns home in the evening.</li>
</ul>

<p>Students with ADHD often have difficulty appreciating the social consequences of their behavior and actions and may have poorly developed social interaction skills. They tend to be slow in maturing across the board, particularly in their social and emotional development. Sometimes it is important to treat them like chronologically younger children. Participation in a social skill group within the school setting to learn social skills training is recommended. This might be led by the school guidance counselor or social worker. Social behavioral goals should be established with the student and a reward program should be implemented.</p>
