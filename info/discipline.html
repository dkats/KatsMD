	<h2>Toddlers</h2>

		<p><strong>Praise:</strong> Reinforce good behavior by offering praise when your child does well and learn to pay positive attention to them. Children seek approval for the things that they do, especially from their parents. Let your child know if they are following the rules or made an effort to do something that you wanted. Give them a hug, kiss, or smile if they have been sitting quietly, complete a chore without problems, or are playing cooperatively. Also give verbal signs of approval, such as "great job," or "I like it when you&hellip;" Be sure to comment on specific behaviors or actions. You will <u>not</u> spoil your child by praising good behavior.</p>

		<p><strong>Rephrase the "no":</strong> Make statements that encourage the behavior you want to see. "Let's drive the train." instead of "don't throw that." Offer praise when you see positive behaviors so this will continue.</p>

		<p><strong>Give choices:</strong> This allows your child some feeling of independence.</p>

		<p><strong>Distract and divert:</strong> Redirect attention to desired activities and objects to play with.</p>

		<p><strong>Set limits:</strong> Much of your discipline depends upon your ability to set limits. Boundaries provide security for your child if their adventurous spirit leads them to explore, but inexperience may lead them astray. Limit-setting teaches a valuable lesson for life: the world is full of yeses and nos. You decide what behavior you cannot allow and stick to that limit. This will be different for each family and each stage of development.</p>

		<p><strong>Take charge:</strong> Toddlers want control. Adults who are taking charge and creating limit are available as a safe and secure homebase they can leave and return to at will for comfort and reassurance. In this way, parents help them develop their own inner controls. They learned from parent-supported failures. It is not what we are doing <u>to</u> our children; it is what we are doing <u>for</u> and <u>with</u> them, and what they are doing for themselves.</p>

		<p><strong>Provide structure:</strong> When your child reaches one year of age, another title is added to the parenting job description: architect of your child's environment. By taking on this job you steer the child's energies toward enjoyable learning experiences and away from harm. You create structure, which does not mean being inflexible, repressive, or domineering. On the contrary, what we mean by "structure" is setting the conditions that encourage desirable behavior to happen. Babyproofing the home is one way to create structure by creating a positive environment for the child. By a bit of preplanning you remove most of the "nos" so that a generally "yes" environment prevails.</p>

	<h2>Hitting</h2>

		<p>When your child behaves aggressively, be clear with him that it's not their anger you disapprove of, but the violent expression of it. Don't tell them not to get angry or not to show that they're angry. Simply acknowledge the feeling&mdash;and perhaps even sympathize with it&mdash;but then remind them that it's much more constructive to use words to tell you why they're upset.</p>

		<p>Please try not to take your child's behavior personally&mdash;many toddlers go through a stage of hitting or biting the hand that feeds them! Try to remember that you aren't doing anything wrong&mdash;this is typical behavior of your child's age group. Hands are communication tools, especially for pre-verbal toddlers. Still, hitting can be very annoying and certainly puts a damper on the time that you and your child spend together.</p>

		<p>That said, here are a few things you can do&mdash;or stop doing&mdash;to help tame those hitting little hands:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Don't spank:</strong> Using spanking as a consequence can especially confuse your child, because you are trying to teach that hitting is wrong.</li>
			<li><strong>Track the trigger:</strong> Keep a diary of the situations that seem to trigger the hitting episodes. Are they tired, bored, hungry, or angry? See if there is a pattern, and once you've identified the trigger, try to address it.</li>
			<li><strong>Offer alternative means of communication:</strong> In most cases, children don't hit out of anger or frustration&mdash;often, it's just a confused way of getting your attention. The key to quelling this type of hitting is to show how to communicate with hands using more gentle gestures. Try to substitute a positive behavior for an annoying one: next time your child is about to hit you, immediately distract them with a more pleasant interaction, such as playing a game they enjoy or giving them a favorite toy to hold. If this doesn't work, then, when they hit, tell them: "We don't hit, we hug." You can also take their hand and show them how to pat your arm or face gently while talking about it. Continually demonstrating and discussing alternative gestures requires patience; this concept may take some time to sink in.</li>

	<h2>Biting</h2>
		
		<p>Biting is a very common behavior among toddlers, which means there are a lot of concerned parents out there. You are not alone. The good news is that there is a lot that parents and caregivers can do to reduce and, ultimately, eliminate biting.</p>

		<p>Children bite in order to cope with a challenge or fulfill a need. For example, your child may be biting to express a strong feeling (like frustration), communicate a need for personal space (maybe another child is standing too close) or to satisfy a need for oral stimulation. Trying your best to understand the underlying cause of the biting will help you develop an effective response. This makes it more likely that you will be successful in eliminating the behavior.</p>

		<p>Toddlers may bite for the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lack language skills necessary for expressing important needs or strong feelings like anger, frustration, joy, etc. </li>
			<li>Are overwhelmed by the sounds, light or activity level in this setting</li>
			<li>Are experimenting to see what will happen</li>
			<li>Need more active playtime</li>
			<li>Are over-tired</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What to do</h3>
			<ul>
				<lil>When a toddler bites, you might feel frustrated, infuriated, annoyed, embarrassed, and/or worried. All of these feelings are normal, but remain <strong>calm</strong>.</lil>
				<li>In a firm, matter-of-fact voice say: <strong>"No biting, biting hurts."</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Comment on how the other child is feeling</strong>: "Look, Arthur is crying. He is crying because you bit him. Biting hurts." Keep it short, simple and clear.</li>
				<li>Next, <strong>shift your attention</strong> to the child who was bitten.</li>
			</ul>
