<h4>What is acne?</h4>

	<p>Acne is a very common disease that affects up to 85% of teenagers. It is a problem of the small hair follicles (or pores) especially of the face, neck, chest and back. These hair follicles (pores) have large and active oil glands attached to them, which produce the oil found on your skin. This oil is called sebum. Hormones control the production of sebum. Because hormones become active in puberty, acne tends to be more common during the teenage years.</p>

<h4>What causes acne?</h4>

	<p>Acne occurs when the opening of the pore becomes clogged with skin cells from the lining of the pore. When this occurs the plug may be visible as a black head or white head. A white head is a small skin colored bump in the skin. A black head is a dark colored plug in the center of a pore. The dark color of a black head is not dirt. It is merely the pigment of the skin cells in the plug.</p>

	<p>The bacteria, <em>P. acnes</em>, which normally lives in the deep portion of everyone's pores lives off the sebum. This results in the red, swollen bumps and pimples commonly seen in acne.</p>

	<p>Cysts and nodules are pimples that have become very large and deep. These are often tender and have a higher risk of leaving scars behind.</p>

<h4>What does NOT cause acne?</h4>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Acne is not caused by poor hygiene. In fact, washing too vigorously can make acne worse.</li>
		<li>Acne is not caused by any sexual practice.</li>
		<li>Acne is not caused by eating any specific food (this includes chocolate, French fries or other fatty foods, or soda). However, there is some evidence that milk (because of hormones in milk) and high glycemic load diets (lots of sugar and starches like candy, fruit juice, pasta, rice, potato) can worsen acne, and decreasing foods these can help improve acne.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>How is acne treated?</h4>
	
	<p>The general concepts of acne treatment are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Treat the problem of the skin cells that are clogging the pores.</li>
		<li>Minimize the <em>P. acnes</em> bacteria that live in the follicle. This will help decrease the pimples and cysts.</li>
		<li>Reduce inflammation and shrink oil glands.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are many nonprescription products available and may be helpful for very mild acne. Wash all areas affected with acne for about 20-30 seconds and rinse once or twice daily. Benzoyl peroxide is a topical antibacterial agent that helps decrease red pimples and pustules by suppressing the bacteria in the pores responsible for the development of these lesions. Routine treatment usually takes several weeks to months to see improvement and needs to be continued to maintain the effect. (Do not stop using when your skin clears or the acne will return in a few weeks.) Occasional side effects are redness, flaking and bleaching of fabrics. A moisturizer and decreasing the amount used can help control these if they occur.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Sensitive Face Wash (5% benzoyl peroxide)</li>
			<li>Advanced Face Wash (10% benzoyl peroxide)</li>
			<li>Treatment Pads (2.5% benzoyl peroxide): apply and do not wash off</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>4% BPO Acne Creamy Wash with DMI (4% Benzoyl Peroxide)</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>More severe cases of acne require prescription medications. There are many prescription medications used to treat acne:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Topical retinoids (Retin-A, Differin, Tazorac) work by decreasing the sticky cells that clog pores and prevent further clogging.</li>
		<li>Topical antibiotics/antibacterials (benzoyl peroxide, erythromycin, clindamycin, dapsone) work by killing the <em>P. acnes</em> bacteria and reducing inflammation (red bumps and pus bumps).</li>
		<li>Oral antibiotics (tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) also kill the <em>P. acnes</em> bacteria and help decrease inflammation. They are reserved for patients with deeper cysts, scars or more severe acne.</li>
		<li>Oral retinoids: Isotretinoin (brand names: Accutane, Amnesteem, Claravis, Sotret) work by shrinking oil glands, greatly diminishing oil production and decreasing blocked pores. It is only for very severe nodular, cystic or scarring acne, or for severe acne where all other treatments have failed.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>	Some patients have a hormonal component to their acne and in women, birth control pills (oral contraceptives) or antiandrogen agents, such as spironolactone, can also be prescribed to treat acne.</p>

<h4>How should you care for your skin with acne?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Only use mild cleansers on your skin affected with acne. Cetaphil DermaControl Oil Control Foam Wash is a good choice.</li>
		<li>Don't use abrasive soaps, harsh shampoos, astringents or after shaves with alcohol.</li>
		<li>Don't over wash your face, twice daily is best. Increased washing will not improve your acne. It may make it worse.</li>
		<li>Don't pick or squeeze pimples. While it may decrease the size of the pimple on the surface, it pushes some of the contents deeper in the skin and causes deeper nodules and increases scarring.</li>
		<li>Use all medications as directed. The routine use of medications is the only way to achieve the desired results. Spot treating pimples will not make them go away faster. It may cause increased irritation, however.</li>
		<li>Use products on acne-prone areas that are labeled "non-comedogenic". These are less likely to worsen acne.</li>
		<li>Protect your skin from excessive sunlight including use of sunscreens and moisturizers if necessary. Cetaphil DermaControl Oil Control Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is a good choice.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Very important facts everyone with acne must know.</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Acne is not curable, once your acne looks better you must continue to use your medicine or it will get worse again (usually in a few weeks after not using regularly).</li>
		<li>Acne medicine must be used regularly as directed or it will not work. No exceptions!</li>
		<li>Most acne medicines improve acne by 50-70%. They rarely make your acne go away. Have realistic expectations.</li>
		<li>Acne medicines take a while to work maximally. Most topical medicines take 3 months for maximum effect, but often start working during the first month of regular use.</li>
