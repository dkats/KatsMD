<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">12 Month (1 Year) Visit</h1>

<p>Find new ways to soothe your child - like a blanket, toy or even a silly song. When you find something that works, encourage your child to use it over and over again to help calm down.</p>

<p><strong>Celebrate</strong> every word or sound your child makes and add to it! If they say "bah bah," you can answer with "yes that’s your bottle and it’s big!" This helps them to learn even more words.</p>

<p>Since you want to teach your child to use words to communicate, try <strong>limiting the pacifier</strong> to the crib. This lets children practice new words and new ways to calm down during the day.</p>

<p>Look for signs that your baby’s memory is growing&mdash;do they get their shoes when they hear you say "let's go outside?" They understand and remember much more than they can say, and they are watching you and the world around them!</p>

<p>Conversations don't just have to be with words. You can use your <strong>hands</strong> to tell a story too and connect movement with language!</p>
