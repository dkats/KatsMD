<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">12 Month (1 Year) Visit</h1>

<p>Find new ways to soothe your child - like a blanket, toy or even a silly song. When you find something that works, encourage your child to use it over and over again to help calm down.</p>

<p><strong>Celebrate</strong> every word or sound your child makes and add to it! If they say "bah bah," you can answer with "yes that’s your bottle and it’s big!" This helps them to learn even more words.</p>

<p>Since you want to teach your child to use words to communicate, try <strong>limiting the pacifier</strong> to the crib. This lets children practice new words and new ways to calm down during the day.</p>

<p>Look for signs that your baby’s memory is growing&mdash;do they get their shoes when they hear you say "let's go outside?" They understand and remember much more than they can say, and they are watching you and the world around them!</p>

<p>Conversations don't just have to be with words. You can use your <strong>hands</strong> to tell a story too and connect movement with language!</p>

<h3>Language Development</h3>

	<p>Continue to encourage language development with constant labeling, pointing, and narrating simple tasks throughout the day. Make reading books more interactive with flaps, textures, tabs. Simple language with short phrases, rhymes, and repetition are ideal. Make book/reading time a standard part of a bedtime/nap routine. ??Offer simple choices with 2 objects and encourage the child to point or verbally express their preference.</p>

	<p>In general, the following strategies can be used to encourage continued language development:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Self-Talk: Narrate what you are doing continuously as you are doing it.</li>
		<li>Parallel Talk: Narrate what your child is doing as s/he engages in activities.</li>
		<li>Imitation: Repeat any of your child's attempts at vocalization, even if these are not yet true words.</li>
		<li>Expansion: Add more sounds and words to what your child says.</li>
		<li>Reciprocity: When your child makes sounds, try to create a volley of turns back and forth.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Physical Development</h3>

	<p>Give your child challenges with gross motor tasks, such as crawling over a pile of pillows in an obstacle course, signing up for swim lessons, or taking a class through Gymboree/My Gym. Explore different toddler playgrounds so s/he can crawl through tunnels, climb up different obstacles, and balance on small ride-on toys (with support as needed).</p>

	<p>Try some of these at-home ideas. Any activity that encourages balance and coordination of large muscle groups is helpful.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>March in "parades" around the house or dance to music.</li>
		<li>Play games such as the "Hokey-pokey," "Ring-Around-the-Rosie."</li>
		<li>Encouraging jumping (e.g., supporting @FNAME@ as *** attempts to jump from a bottom step onto the ground). Place pillows, cushions or a mattress on the floor and jump.</li>
		<li>Get on the floor and play peek-a-boo, hide-and-seek, build a fort and crawl behind furniture.</li>
		<li>Set up an obstacle course.</li>
		<li>Ball play. Throwing, rolling, catching and kicking.</li>
		<li>Imitate the way animals move: slither like a snake, hop like a bunny, waddle like a penguin, spring like a kangaroo.</li>
		<li>Running after bubbles.</li>
		<li>Spending consistent time at playgrounds</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Social Development</h3>

	<p>Work on a structured approach to develop self-soothing skills and more independent self-regulation. At 1 year of age, it is appropriate for your child to start playing for short periods of time by her/himself. Try to start with short periods of quiet play with one toy to help her/him focus. You can also sit her/him in a highchair to limit distractions. Let her/him explore the toy on her/his own. It is ok if s/he gets frustrated or cries for short periods of time before immediately responding. Each week you can increase the amount of quiet time play that s/he has to help her/him start to learn how to focus on one task as well as occupy himself without your aid.</p>
