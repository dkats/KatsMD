<h2>Reducing Allergens in the Home</h2>

	<p>There are many things in every home that can make asthma/allergy symptoms start or get worse. These things are called triggers. Below is a list of common triggers, and important steps you can take to control them in your home.</p>

	<h4>Dust mite</h4>
		<p>Put your child's mattress, pillow, and box springs in plastic/vinyl casings or special hypoallergenic fabric casings that close with a zipper.</p>
		<p>Wash bedding weekly in hot water; use a dryer rather than line drying.</p>
		<p>Remove stuffed animal or toys from the child's bed. Wash them in hot water (at least 130 &deg;F) regularly. If they can't be washed, place it in a plastic bag in the freezer for 24 hours. Freezing it will kill the dust mites.</p>
		<p>Do not let child sleep or lie on stuffed, upholstered furniture. Have child sit in a leather, wood, or vinyl chair. (A bean bag is a good choice for older children.)</p>
		<p>Do not dust or vacuum while child is in the home.</p>
		<p>Remove carpeting, if possible.</p>

	<h4>Indoor mold</h4>
		<p>Use bleach or other mold-killing solution to clean bathrooms, kitchens, and basements.</p>
		<p>Use air conditioning and keep windows closed, if possible.</p>
		<p>Use a dehumidifier, if available, and empty the pan daily.</p>
		<p>Do not use vaporizers.</p>
		<p>Avoid house plants.</p>
		<p>Avoid mowing grass or raking leaves.</p>
		<p>Repair water leaks.</p>
		<p>Run a room HEPA filter air cleaner in the child's bedroom, with the door closed.</p>

	<h4>Pets</h4>
		<p>Remove animal(s) from the home or keep them strictly outdoors.</p>
		<p>Wash pet every week.</p>
		<p>Choose a pet without fur or feathers.</p>
		<p>If you cannot remove the pet from the home, keep it out of the patient's bedroom and run a HEPA filter in the bedroom, with the door closed.</p>

	<h4>Cigarette smoke</h4>
		<p>Do not allow cigarette, cigar, or pipe smoking in the home or car.</p>

	<h4>Cockroaches</h4>
		<p>Have home treated regularly, or use insect spray while child is out of the home for 24 hours. Roach traps may also be helpful.</p>
		<p>Keep kitchen counters and floors free of food and crumbs.</p>
		<p>Keep foods in airtight containers.</p>
		<p>Trash bags should be kept closed.</p>
		<p>Throw away piles of paper and grocery bags.</p>

	<h4>Odors and sprays</h4>
		<p>Avoid burning of wood, incense and scented candles.</p>
		<p>Avoid perfumes, air fresheners, hairspray and strong-smelling cleaning products.</p>

	<h4>Pollen and outdoor molds</h4>
		<p>Keep the windows closed during the pollen seasons.</p>
		<p>Change the air conditioning filters monthly during the pollen season, and use a good quality filter.</p>
