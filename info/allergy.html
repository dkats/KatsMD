<h2>Emergency Preparedness</h2>

	<p>Be comfortable knowing which symptoms suggest a severe allergic reaction and when to use self-injectable epinephrine. This should be discussed with your healthcare provider. A written allergy action plan is very helpful in an emergency and in training others who care for your child. A form is available from <a href="https://www.foodallergy.org/living-food-allergies/food-allergy-essentials/food-allergy-anaphylaxis-emergency-care-plan">www.foodallergy.org</a>. Ask your healthcare provider to fill one out and explain it to you.</p>

	<p>Epinephrine is the first line treatment for anaphylaxis. Always have self-injectable epinephrine available. It is wise to have two doses on hand, as some people may need a second dose. Discuss this with your healthcare provider. Practice with training devices and make sure that you are comfortable enough to not only give epinephrine if needed, but to teach other caregivers how as well.</p>

	<p>After treating with epinephrine, call your local ambulance service and tell them that a child is having an allergic reaction and may need more epinephrine. (An ambulance should be called not because epinephrine is dangerous, but because the allergic reaction was severe, needed to be treated with epinephrine, and may need more treatment.)</p>

<h2>Prevention</h2>

	<p>Oral ingestion is the most common and serious form of exposure. Read labels to completely avoid even the smallest amount of the allergen. Labels should be read prior to eating the food. Ingredients can change without notification. Get familiar with current labeling laws and how they relate to your specific allergens. Avoid foods that contain advisory statements (processed in a facility, etc.) for the food allergen. Also, read the labels of skin products, supplements and pet food.</p>

	<p>Healthy skin helps keep allergens out of our bodies; some skin exposures can cause local hives. The smell of a food does not cause an allergic reaction, but breathing in cooking vapors or powdered, crushed, or dust forms of an allergen has been reported by some to induce a reaction. These types of reactions are typically mild, but in rare cases people have reported experiencing severe reactions.</p>

	<p>Cross contact occurs when a food allergen comes in contact with food or an item not intended to contain that allergen. Scraping off or picking allergens out of a food <strong>will not</strong> make it safe; instead, replace it with a completely new food item. Do not be afraid to ask questions to make sure the item is safe. Know the common sources of cross contact. Do not share utensils, beverages or food, and wash hands prior to eating and, if possible, before touching the face. Saliva from other people and pets can also contain allergen if recently eaten. Most importantly, if you are unsure if an item is safe, do not eat the item!</p>

	<p>The child, all caregivers, and anyone responsible for food preparation should know about the allergy. Consider medical alert notification jewelry. Educate all caregivers who have responsibility for the child. Include children in developmentally appropriate self management skills (hand washing, allergen avoidance, saying “no thank you,” reporting symptoms, etc.).</p>

<h2>Reducing Allergens in the Home</h2>

	<p>There are many things in every home that can make asthma/allergy symptoms start or get worse. These things are called triggers. Below is a list of common triggers, and important steps you can take to control them in your home.</p>

	<h4>Dust mite</h4>
		<p>Put your child's mattress, pillow, and box springs in plastic/vinyl casings or special hypoallergenic fabric casings that close with a zipper.</p>
		<p>Wash bedding weekly in hot water; use a dryer rather than line drying.</p>
		<p>Remove stuffed animal or toys from the child's bed. Wash them in hot water (at least 130 &deg;F) regularly. If they can't be washed, place it in a plastic bag in the freezer for 24 hours. Freezing it will kill the dust mites.</p>
		<p>Do not let child sleep or lie on stuffed, upholstered furniture. Have child sit in a leather, wood, or vinyl chair. (A bean bag is a good choice for older children.)</p>
		<p>Do not dust or vacuum while child is in the home.</p>
		<p>Remove carpeting, if possible.</p>

	<h4>Indoor mold</h4>
		<p>Use bleach or other mold-killing solution to clean bathrooms, kitchens, and basements.</p>
		<p>Use air conditioning and keep windows closed, if possible.</p>
		<p>Use a dehumidifier, if available, and empty the pan daily.</p>
		<p>Do not use vaporizers.</p>
		<p>Avoid house plants.</p>
		<p>Avoid mowing grass or raking leaves.</p>
		<p>Repair water leaks.</p>
		<p>Run a room HEPA filter air cleaner in the child's bedroom, with the door closed.</p>

	<h4>Pets</h4>
		<p>Remove animal(s) from the home or keep them strictly outdoors.</p>
		<p>Wash pet every week.</p>
		<p>Choose a pet without fur or feathers.</p>
		<p>If you cannot remove the pet from the home, keep it out of the patient's bedroom and run a HEPA filter in the bedroom, with the door closed.</p>

	<h4>Cigarette smoke</h4>
		<p>Do not allow cigarette, cigar, or pipe smoking in the home or car.</p>

	<h4>Cockroaches</h4>
		<p>Have home treated regularly, or use insect spray while child is out of the home for 24 hours. Roach traps may also be helpful.</p>
		<p>Keep kitchen counters and floors free of food and crumbs.</p>
		<p>Keep foods in airtight containers.</p>
		<p>Trash bags should be kept closed.</p>
		<p>Throw away piles of paper and grocery bags.</p>

	<h4>Odors and sprays</h4>
		<p>Avoid burning of wood, incense and scented candles.</p>
		<p>Avoid perfumes, air fresheners, hairspray and strong-smelling cleaning products.</p>

	<h4>Pollen and outdoor molds</h4>
		<p>Keep the windows closed during the pollen seasons.</p>
		<p>Change the air conditioning filters monthly during the pollen season, and use a good quality filter.</p>
