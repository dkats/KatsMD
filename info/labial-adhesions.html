<h2>What is the treatment for labial adhesions?</h2>

	<p>Whether or not treatment is recommended depends on how severe the adhesions are.</p>

	<p><strong>Small or mild</strong> adhesions do not cover the vaginal opening and may separate by themselves when the child reaches puberty or earlier. Your child’s health care provider will continue to watch how the labia appear over time, and may recommend treatment if the adhesions get worse or cause symptoms.</p>

	<p><strong>Slightly larger or moderate</strong> adhesions that cover the lower part of the vagina may be treated with a mild emollient, Vaseline® or  A&D ointment®, along with gentle separation twice a day over several weeks.</p>

	<p><strong>Significant</strong> adhesions that cover the vaginal opening, and often the urinary opening as well, can be effectively treated with an estrogen-containing cream or steroid cream. These adhesions may prevent drainage of normal vaginal secretions, as well as impair the flow of urine. Sometimes this will cause urine to collect in the lower vagina, behind the adhesion, and can lead to irritation or dribbling of urine after your child stops urinating. If she develops a fever, it will not be possible to collect a clean urine specimen to see if she has a urinary tract infection. The most effective treatment for significant adhesions is an estrogen-containing cream applied twice daily for a period of time or until the adhesions resolve. This treatment requires a prescription from a health care provider.</p>

<h2>How is estrogen cream applied to the labia?</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>When possible have your child soak in a warm tub bath before you apply the (estrogen) cream. The water will remove any secretions and soften the labia.</li>
		<li>Help your child gently dry her vulva with a soft towel.</li>
		<li>Place your child in frog-leg position, as shown by your health care provider.</li>
		<li>Stand next to your child, facing her feet.</li>
		<li>When your child’s vulva is completely dry, squeeze a <strong>small (pea-size)</strong> amount of (estrogen) cream on your pinkie or on the index finger of your dominant hand. (For example, if you are right handed, put the cream on your right pinkie or your right index finger and vice versa if you are left handed). Use your other hand to gently separate the outer labia (lips). Look for the white line, where the labia are stuck together. It will run up and down from the top of the adhesion towards the perineum (the area above the anal opening).</li>
		<li>After the estrogen is applied, wait for about five minutes before putting on underwear or a diaper to ensure that the cream has maximally absorbed into the skin.</li>
		<li>While keeping the outer lips separated with one hand, gently apply the cream to the adhesion line. Avoid touching the anal opening.</li>
		<li>Once the adhesions start to separate, <strong>try to avoid putting the estrogen cream inside the vaginal opening</strong>.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>*More is <u>not</u> better</strong>, and making sure that the estrogen cream is applied directly to the adhesion is important.  Apply the estrogen cream sparingly. Too much estrogen cream can cause a side eggects such as darkening of the vulvar skin, breast buds, and rarely vaginal bleeding. However, all of these symptoms will resolve after the treatment is discontinued.</p>
