<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Bleach Baths</h1>

<p>Soaking in a tub with a small amount of bleach added to the water 2-3 times per week can help control eczema. Bleach baths, which are similar to swimming in a chlorinated pool, are easy to do at home:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Add 1/2 cup of plain household bleach (sodium hypochlorite) OR 1/3 cup of concentrated household bleach to a full tub of lukewarm bathwater and stir the water to dilute the bleach. Make sure you use PLAIN bleach; splash-free or scented bleach products are not effective and could lead to more irritation.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Use <strong>plain</strong> bleach; splash-free or scented bleach products are not effective and could lead to more irritation.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>If using an infant tub, use 2 tablespoons of bleach to a full tub of water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have your child soak in the bath for 10-15 minutes. Try to soak the entire body. Since the bath is like a swimming pool, it is safe to get your child's face and scalp wet as well. For babies and young children, use touch supervision to avoid drowning as you would during regular bath time.</p>

<p>Rinse the dilute bleach water off at the end of the bath and apply a moisturizer right away.</p>
