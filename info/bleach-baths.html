<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Bleach Baths</h1>

<p>Soaking in a tub with a small amount of bleach added to the water 2-3 times per week can help control eczema. Bleach baths, which are similar to swimming in a chlorinated pool, are easy to do at home.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The concentration of sodium hypochlorite in some household bleach bottles has been increased from 6 % to 8.25%. Therefore, the 8.25% solution is &frac13; more concentrated. The instructions below are for the <u>6% concentration</u>. It is not a problem if you use the 8.25% concentration bleach, but <u>use &frac13; less bleach</u> or use &frac13; more water.</p>

<p>Make sure you use <u>plain</u> bleach; splash-free or scented bleach products are not effective and could lead to more irritation.</p>

<p>A normal tub contains about 26 gallons of water. &frac12; tub of water is equivalent to 13 gallons.</p>

<h3>For Infants and Children:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Fill tub &frac14; to &frac12; way with lukewarm water</li>
		<li>Mix in &frac14; to &frac12; cup of unscented household bleach to the bath water</li>
		<li>For infants above 3 months old, some say add 1 teaspoon of unscented bleach (i.e. Clorox), into bath water</li>
		<li>Bleach baths are generally not recommended for infants below 3 months old, unless your physician advises otherwise</li>
		<li>The bleach bath should be used below the neck line. Avoid contact with the eyes, face, mouth and nose. If these areas come in contact, quickly rinse the area off thoroughly with fresh water. Remember, the concentration of bleach is very very low in a bleach bath</li>
		<li>Have the child under direct adult supervision soak body, specifically the affected area, in the water solution for 10-15 minutes, or as directed by your physician</li>
		<li>Infants and children must be monitored by an adult at all times during preparation and administration of a bleach bath. Keep bleach solution out of eyes, mouth, and hair</li>
		<li>Rinse body thoroughly with freshwater</li>
		<li>Apply emollients or lotions as directed by your physician</li>
		<li>Repeat bleach baths 2 to 3 times a week, or as your physician recommends, to see positive results</li>
	</ul>

<h3>For Teens and Adults:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Fill tub half way (13 gallons of water) with lukewarm or warm water</li>
		<li>Mix &frac14; to &frac12; cup of unscented household bleach to the bath</li>
		<li>The bleach bath should be used below the neck line. Avoid contact with the eyes, face, mouth and nose. If these areas come in contact, quickly rinse the area off thoroughly with fresh water. Remember, the concentration of bleach is very low in a bleach bath</li>
		<li>Soak body, specifically the affected area, in the water solution for 10-20 minutes, or as directed by your physician. Keep bleach solution out of eyes, mouth, and hair</li>
