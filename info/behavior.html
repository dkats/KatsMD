<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Behavioral Regulation</h1>

	<h2>General strategies for helping your child with self regulation</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Use a consistent plan at home and at school in approaching different behaviors (sleep, eating, becoming comfortable with new people). Consistent routines are comforting for young children.</li>
			<li>Continue to use social stories and consistent routines at home and school.</li>
			<li>Use a daily sensory protocol to address mild hypersensitivity to touch and auditory input and meet movement thresholds.</li>
			<li>Create opportunities for your child to learn to self calm: try sensory inhibition through firm deep pressure and linear movement (slow movement over ball or in parents arms). Set up a calm down tent or corner.</li>
			<li>Help your child transition to next activity using their soothing object, warning gently in advance it is time to go or to move outside, etc. Use pictures or photos as needed. Give your child a simple task. "We are going to the store: can you carry the bag?"</li>
			<li>Use clear limit setting and/or don't ask just tell the child in a calm voice: It is time to leave, the toys go in my bag, etc.</li>
			<li>Help your child be self reliant. Use the clean up song. Tell your child when they are doing a good job.</li>
			<li>If your child is struggling, think about how you can build in success at the moment. Introduce a task they can easily master, for example.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Games for attention</h2>
		<p><strong>Feely Game</strong><br />
		Hide common objects one at a time in a paper bag or a clean sock<br />
		Have your child place his hand in the bag and guess what the object is<br />
		Examples of objects: toothbrush, comb, sponge, fruit (apple, orange), leave rock, hairbrush, pencil, crayon, card</p>
		
		<p><strong>Sound game</strong><br />
		Play a single sound from your phone<br />
		Have your child guess the sound<br />
		Ideas: ringing phone, ringing door bell, knocking, flushing toilet, dog barking, water running, Microwave beeping, piano playing, rain falling, kettle whistling, birds chirping, wind chimes</p>
		
		<p><strong>Happening book</strong><br />
		Paper, crayons, note book or ring binder, tape or glue stick<br />
		Date each page with your child's name and the date<br />
		IF you go to the park, collect some items from the park and have your child glue on the page.<br />
		If you are at the hospital, find some items from the visit and have your child glue on the page</p>
		
		<p><strong>Hunting game</strong><br />
		Hide simple objects in one or two rooms of your apartment in places your child can find<br />
		Examples are poker chips, popsicle sticks, pennies<br />
		Hide in sneakers, on shelves, or other obvious places<br />
		Tell you child how many items to look for 5, 10</p>
		
		<p><strong>Shadow games</strong><br />
		Have your child imitate the movements of an older sibling<br />
		Say Can you make my shape<br />
		This can be like Simon Says</p>
		
		<p><strong>Make a collage</strong><br />
		A collage is an art project.<br />
		Gather objects to blue on paper or thick cardboard<br />
		Straws, cotton balls, leaves, fabric scraps, buttons, ribbons, macaroni</p>
		
		<p><strong>Finger paint</strong><br /> with shaving cream or finger paint</p>
		
		<p><strong>Ripping and rolling newspaper</strong><br />
		Take one sheet of newspaper and open it<br />
		Rip in little pieces<br />
		Rip in strips of paper<br />
		When tired of ripping, place paper in a paper bag, wrap the end with tape, and use your paper ball for throwing and kicking</p>

	<h2>Sensory activities</h2>
		<p>Parents are encouraged to provide a variety of these activities at home to begin to develop an appropriate sensory protocol in the home environment. Having a variety of sensory strategies will help with self regulation if needed.</p>

		<p><strong>Tactile/touch</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pushing on hands and feet prior to "messy" play</li>
			<li>Pushing palms together or pushing hands on a ball or wall for meeting sensory needs</li>
			<li>Sensory play in bins of various foods to decrease sensitivity to touch and provide calming input for increasing focus and attention</li>
			<ul>
				<li>dry rice</li>
				<li>beans</li>
				<li>small pasta</li>
				<li>wet sand</li>
				<li>oatmeal mixed with water</li>
				<li>whipped cream</li>
				<li>playdough (you can make your own)</li>
				<li>bread dough</li>
				<li>pudding</li>
				<li>applesauce</li>
				<li>wet noodles</li>
				<li>cut up fruits (e.g., peaches, bananas)</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<p>Gather objects for a special sensory box, including rubber toys to squeeze and pull.</p>

		<p><strong>Proprioceptive/body awareness</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pushing and pulling toddler-size wagons or carts (you can add up to 10% of your child's weight for added proprioceptive input by using 2 lb bags of beans (wrapped and taped if necessary))</li>
			<li>Carrying a child-size backpack with 2 lbs of objects inside</li>
			<li>Choose toys that provide pushing and pulling actions: plastic accordion tubes, Gertie balls, koosh balls, small bean bags, toy drums, hammer pegs, pound and roll tower toys, magnetic blocks, blocks which snap together, rubber pegboard and pegs</li>
			<li>Wrapping or rolling child in soft towel for deep pressure input or big firm hugs</li>
			<li>Sitting on Mom's or Dad's lap while bouncing up and down or moving side to side</li>
			<li>Bouncing on a small therapy ball or Rody</li>
			<li>Blow bubbles or kisses </li>
			<li>Drink from a straw</li>
			<li>Pillow squeezes</li>
			<li>Crawling through cotton tunne</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Vestibular/movement</strong><br />
		<ul>
			<li>These activities provide movement input and the more your child engages in these tasks, the more they will meet their thresholds for movement</li>
			<li>Swing on playground swings daily; if acceptable climb up and down slide</li>
			<li>Rolling on large cushions or pillows, carpets, and different textured surfaces</li>
			<li>Swinging in parents' arms in a blanket</li>
			<li>Sitting in stroller or plastic laundry basket filled with pillows and pushing your child forward and backwards or slowly three times in a circle one way and then three times in a circle the other way. If your child becomes over-aroused, follow this activity with jumping or gently pushing on the head</li>
			<li>Moving through an obstacle course set up in the house: For example: climbing under a bench, rolling to an object, kicking a ball, turning three times and stopping</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Try a motor activity prior to mealtimes to prepare your child to seat for the mealtime (playground play, running outside, riding toys, playing ball, etc.)</p>

		<p><strong>Auditory</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Music can be very calming, focusing, and fun</li>
			<li>Some programs recommend playing Mozart for 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the evening</li>
			<li>Diminish  back ground noise conversation, TV, radio</li>
			<li>Teach your child to use a quiet corner to play and look at picture books</li>
			<li>Build a quiet corner with a pop up tent filled with quiet toys (books, pillows, stuffed animals)</li>
			<li>Limit time in noisy environments or take frequent breaks</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Tactile sensory strategies to assist with mealtimes</strong><br />
		Tactile/touch: activity to reduce sensory sensitivity to touch</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Manipulating play dough or modeling clay</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Tantrums</h2>

		<p>Temper tantrums are a normal part of growing up.</p>

		<h3>Why do tantrums happen?</h3>
			
			<p>A tantrum is the expression of a young child's frustration with the challenges of the moment. Perhaps your child is having trouble figuring something out or completing a specific task. Maybe your child doesn't have the vocabulary or can't find the words to express his or her feelings. Frustration might trigger anger&mdash;resulting in a temper tantrum.</p>

			<p>If your child is thirsty, hungry, or tired, his or her threshold for frustration is likely to be lower&mdash;and a tantrum more likely.</p>

		<h3>Do young children have tantrums on purpose?</h3>

			<p>Young children don't plan to frustrate or embarrass their parents. For most toddlers, tantrums are a way to express frustration. For older children, tantrums might be a learned behavior. If you reward tantrums with something your child wants&mdash;or you allow your child to get out of things by throwing a tantrum&mdash;the tantrums are likely to continue.</p>

		<h3>Can tantrums be prevented?</h3>
			
			<p>There might be no foolproof way to prevent tantrums, but there's plenty you can do to encourage good behavior in even the youngest children.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Be consistent.</strong> Establish a daily routine so that your child knows what to expect. Stick to the routine as much as possible, including nap time and bedtime. Set reasonable limits and follow them consistently.</li>
				<li><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> Run errands when your child isn't likely to be hungry or tired. If you're expecting to wait in line, pack a small toy or snack to occupy your child.</li>
				<li><strong>Encourage your child to use words.</strong> Young children understand many more words than they're able to express. If your child isn't yet speaking&mdash;or speaking clearly&mdash;teach him or her sign language for words such as "I want," "more," "drink," "hurt," and "tired." As your child gets older, help him or her put feelings into words.</li>
				<li><strong>Let your child make choices.</strong> Avoid saying "no" to everything. To give your toddler a sense of control, let him or her make choices. "Would you like to wear your red shirt or your blue shirt?" "Would you like to eat strawberries or bananas?" "Would you like to read a book or build a tower with your blocks?"</li>
				<li><strong>Praise good behavior.</strong> Offer extra attention when your child behaves well. Give your child a hug or tell your child how proud you are when he or she shares or follows directions.</li>
				<li><strong>Avoid situations likely to trigger tantrums.</strong> Don't give your child toys that are far too advanced for him or her. If your child begs for toys or treats when you shop, try to steer clear of areas with these temptations. If your toddler acts up in restaurants, choose places that offer quick service.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<h3>What's the best way to respond to a tantrum?</h3>
		
			<p>Typically, the best way to respond to a tantrum is to stay calm and ignore the behavior. You also might try to distract your child. A different book or a change of location might help. If you can't stay calm and you're at home, leave the room for a minute.</p>

			<p>If your child is hitting or kicking someone, hold him or her until he or she calms down.</p>

			<p>When your child quiets down, you might say, "Tantrums won't get my attention. If you want to tell me something, you have to use your words."</p>
		
		<h3>What if my child becomes destructive or dangerous?</h3>

			<p>If a tantrum escalates, remove your child from the situation and enforce a timeout:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Select a timeout spot.</strong> Seat your child in a boring place, such as in a chair in the living room or on the floor in the hallway. Wait for your child to calm down.</li>
				<li><strong>Stick with it.</strong> If your child begins to wander around before the timeout is over, return him or her to the designated timeout spot. Don't respond to anything your child says while he or she is in timeout.</li>
				<li><strong>Know when to end the timeout.</strong> When your child has calmed down, discuss the reason for the timeout and why the behavior was inappropriate. Then return to your usual activities.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Don't use timeouts too much, however, or they won't work.</p>
		
		<h3>What about tantrums in public?</h3>

			<p>If your child has a tantrum in public, ignore the behavior if possible. If your child becomes too disruptive, take him or her to a private spot for a timeout. After the timeout return to the activity&mdash;or your child will learn that a tantrum is an effective way to escape a given situation.</p>

	<h2>Hitting</h2>

		<p>When your child behaves aggressively, be clear with him that it's not their anger you disapprove of, but the violent expression of it. Don't tell them not to get angry or not to show that they're angry. Simply acknowledge the feeling&mdash;and perhaps even sympathize with it&mdash;but then remind them that it's much more constructive to use words to tell you why they're upset.</p>

		<p>Please try not to take your child's behavior personally&mdash;many toddlers go through a stage of hitting or biting the hand that feeds them! Try to remember that you aren't doing anything wrong&mdash;this is typical behavior of your child's age group. Hands are communication tools, especially for pre-verbal toddlers. Still, hitting can be very annoying and certainly puts a damper on the time that you and your child spend together.</p>

		<p>That said, here are a few things you can do&mdash;or stop doing&mdash;to help tame those hitting little hands:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Don't spank:</strong> Using spanking as a consequence can especially confuse your child, because you are trying to teach that hitting is wrong.</li>
			<li><strong>Track the trigger:</strong> Keep a diary of the situations that seem to trigger the hitting episodes. Are they tired, bored, hungry, or angry? See if there is a pattern, and once you've identified the trigger, try to address it.</li>
			<li><strong>Offer alternative means of communication:</strong> In most cases, children don't hit out of anger or frustration&mdash;often, it's just a confused way of getting your attention. The key to quelling this type of hitting is to show how to communicate with hands using more gentle gestures. Try to substitute a positive behavior for an annoying one: next time your child is about to hit you, immediately distract them with a more pleasant interaction, such as playing a game they enjoy or giving them a favorite toy to hold. If this doesn't work, then, when they hit, tell them: "We don't hit, we hug." You can also take their hand and show them how to pat your arm or face gently while talking about it. Continually demonstrating and discussing alternative gestures requires patience; this concept may take some time to sink in.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Biting</h2>
		
		<p>Biting is a very common behavior among toddlers, which means there are a lot of concerned parents out there. You are not alone. The good news is that there is a lot that parents and caregivers can do to reduce and, ultimately, eliminate biting.</p>

		<p>Children bite in order to cope with a challenge or fulfill a need. For example, your child may be biting to express a strong feeling (like frustration), communicate a need for personal space (maybe another child is standing too close) or to satisfy a need for oral stimulation. Trying your best to understand the underlying cause of the biting will help you develop an effective response. This makes it more likely that you will be successful in eliminating the behavior.</p>

		<p>Toddlers may bite for the following reasons:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lack language skills necessary for expressing important needs or strong feelings like anger, frustration, joy, etc. </li>
			<li>Are overwhelmed by the sounds, light or activity level in this setting</li>
			<li>Are experimenting to see what will happen</li>
			<li>Need more active playtime</li>
			<li>Are over-tired</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What to do</h3>
			<ul>
				<lil>When a toddler bites, you might feel frustrated, infuriated, annoyed, embarrassed, and/or worried. All of these feelings are normal, but remain <strong>calm</strong>.</lil>
				<li>In a firm, matter-of-fact voice say: <strong>"No biting, biting hurts."</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Comment on how the other child is feeling</strong>: "Look, Arthur is crying. He is crying because you bit him. Biting hurts." Keep it short, simple and clear.</li>
				<li>Next, <strong>shift your attention</strong> to the child who was bitten.</li>
			</ul>
