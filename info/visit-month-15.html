<p>Let your little one practice <strong>brushing</strong> their own teeth&hellip;or brush yours while you do theirs. Giving your child independence and "jobs" can help your child to feel in control and important.</p>

<p>Let your child <strong>make a mess</strong> when eating. Throwing or playing with food is normal at this age. Your child is exploring the world, so don't get too upset and remember they aren't trying to misbehave.</p>

<p>When your child is upset, try <strong>distracting</strong> them with something or someone else around them. Remember that they are too young for any punishments, but can be distracted with a book, toy, song, turning the lights on and off, going for a walk, or a silly dance.</p>

<p>Have meals <strong>together</strong> as a family whenever you can. Eating together teaches kids a lot and is a wonderful time to talk and connect as a family.</p>

<p>Giving a <strong>name</strong> to everything around your child builds important skills before school. Talk about colors and textures in your everyday life&mdash;like "the sky is blue" or "that cracker is scratchy." Practice games with labeling too!</p>
