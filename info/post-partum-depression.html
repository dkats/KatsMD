<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Depression and Anxiety During Pregnancy and Post-partum</h1>

	<h3>What is post-partum depression/anxiety?</h3>

		<p>Pregnancy and caring for a new baby can be one of the most joyful and exciting times in a woman's life, but it's also hard work. It is natural for a woman to experience changes in her feelings and mood during pregnancy and after giving birth. However, if unpleasant feelings do not go away after a couple of weeks&mdash;or if they get worse&mdash;they could be signs of post-partum depression or anxiety.</p>

		<p>After the birth of the baby, many new mothers experience what is known as post-partum depression; others experience symptoms of anxiety and/or panic attacks. Together, these are called "mood disorders", which are medical illnesses that can be effectively treated.</p>

	<h3>What are the symptoms?</h3>
	 
		<p>You may experience several of the following symptoms, either during pregnancy or after childbirth. It is important to seek help if symptoms last longer than a few weeks, or if symptoms are severe or worrisome.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Feeling sad</li>
			<li>Crying a lot</li>
			<li>Anxiety</li>
			<li>Trouble concentrating</li>
			<li>Trouble sleeping</li>
			<li>Feeling emotionally numb</li>
			<li>Lack of energy</li>
			<li>Not interested in things you used to enjoy</li>
			<li>Not interested in your baby</li>
			<li>Fear of hurting your baby or yourself</li>
			<li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
			<li>Withdrawing from people</li>
			<li>Feeling Overwhelmed</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>How common is post-partum depression/anxiety?</h3>

		<p>Post-partum depression/anxiety occurs in at least 10% of births. It can happen after any birth, not just after the birth of the first child. It can be very difficult to recognize or admit feelings of depression or anxiety at a time when moms are supposed to be happy.</p>

	<h3>What causes depression during pregnancy or the postpartum period?</h3>
		
		<p>Experts do not know what causes depression during pregnancy or the postpartum period. Research suggests that it is triggered by changes in hormones and that some women are sensitive to those changes. Stress and lack of social support may also contribute. Recent studies indicate that depression often runs in families. We do not fully understand why depression occurs in some women and not others, or why it occurs with some pregnancies and not others.</p>

	<h3>How is post-partum depression/anxiety treated?</h3>
		
		<p>Help is available for depression during pregnancy or the postpartum period. Current treatments include antidepressants, estrogen therapy, psychotherapy, or a combination of these methods.</p>

		<p>By working with doctors, nurses, psychologists, and social workers in the community, we will help you create the best plan to manage your symptoms and get you on the road to a healthier and happier time with your new baby.</p>
