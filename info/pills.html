<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Swallowing pills</h1>

	<ol>
		<li>Start by having your child get a mouth full of water (a big gulp) and look down at the floor. Then, have your child get a mouth full of water, put the capsule in and then look at the floor. The capsule will float to the back of his/her mouth. Then your child should try to swallow the gulp of water.</li>
		<li>Try having your child swallow very small pieces of candy, such as MINI M&M’s, cake sprinkles, tic tacs, etc…as a way to practice swallowing his/her medicine with something very small. Then have your child work his/her way up in the size until the child can swallow pills.</li>
		<li>Sometimes it helps to use food. You can try a spoonful of jello, peanut butter, pudding, applesauce, jam, ice cream, yogurt, etc. Place the pill in the spoonful of food. Then have your child eat the spoonful.</li>
		<li>Have your child take one or two swallows of milk to make his/her tongue and throat wet and slippery. Then have your child take another swallow and hold the liquid in their mouth. Place the pill in the mouth. Have your child tilt his/her head back and swallow.</li>
		<li>Reduce your child’s anxiety about swallowing pills by using a social story.</li>
		<li>Show your child how you swallow pills!</li>
	</ol>
