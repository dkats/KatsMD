<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">4 Year Visit</h1>

<p>Big tasks can be easier if they are broken into pieces with clear instructions about what to do. For example, you can say "please put on your shoes" and then "please get on your jacket" instead of saying "get dressed." This will help your child learn how to problem solve in the future.</p>

<p>Use <strong>mistakes</strong> as an opportunity to learn new things. Mistakes can be upsetting, but avoid yelling or getting upset as mistakes are an important part of learning new solutions and gaining new skills. Help your child think of mistakes as a time to try a new strategy, not give up.</p>

<p>Involve your child in thinking of solutions to problems they face. Ask them for <strong>suggestions</strong> on how to handle a fight with a sibling, how to make a friend feel better or how to fix a broken toy. Involving kids in finding solutions helps make better problem solvers in the future!</p>

<p>When youâ€™re reading together, ask your child questions about how characters in the book think and feel. Talk about "what might happen next" and ask your child "if that was you, what would you do?" <strong>Connecting books to real life experiences</strong> helps your child expand their world and understand others.</p>

<p>Measure and compare things everywhere! Use words like bigger, smaller, taller, wider, more and less.</p>
