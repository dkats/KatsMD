	<h2>Early Childhood Feeding Development</h2>

		<p><strong>When do I start introducing my baby to solid foods?</strong><br />
		Your pediatrician will discuss starting solids with you at the 4-month visit. In general, the recommendation is to start introducing your baby to solid foods between 4-6 months of age.</p>

		<p><strong>When is my baby ready for solid foods?</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Holds his head up well and sits with support</li>
			<li>Shows interest in food, such as watching you eat, reaching for food and opening his mouth when he sees food</li>
			<li>Starting to lose tongue thrust (seeing less pushing of food out of his mouth) when you feed him with a spoon</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Which foods do I start with?</strong><br />
		There is no medical evidence that introducing solid foods in a certain order is better for babies. In the past, infant cereal was recommended as the very first solid food. While this will be an important part of your baby’s diet, it doesn’t have to be the very first food offered. Examples of other first foods include: pureed sweet potato, squash, peas, spinach, carrots, green beans, avocado, meat, fish, bananas, apples, pears, plums, nectarines or blueberries.</p>

		<p><strong>How should I start?</strong><br />
		Eating should be a fun and social event! Here are some tips to help your baby get off to a good start with trying solid foods:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Make sure your baby is in a high chair or sitting up straight to prevent choking. Pull the high chair or seat up close to the table.</li>
			<li>Make it a point to have family meals from your baby’s first feeding.</li>
			<li>Start new foods in the morning or afternoon so you can watch for any reactions. Aim for a time when your baby isn’t very sleepy or hungry. A good time is usually 1 hour after a bottle or nursing.</li>
			<li>Serve small, bite-size portions, too much on the plate can make your child feel overwhelmed. Start with just 1-2 teaspoons of food and then increase the amount slowly over time. Try mixing the food with a little breast milk or formula to thin it out making it more “soupy” and easier to swallow.</li>
			<li>Start with 1 new food every 2-3 days. Watch for new reactions, like a rash, diarrhea or vomiting. If your baby has a reaction to a new food, stop giving it to him and call the doctor.</li>
			<li>Your baby might need to try a new food 10-15 times before he likes it. This is normal. If your baby doesn’t like a new food, try it again in a few weeks.</li>
			<li>Feed your baby until he shows signs of being full. This includes shaking his head or pushing food away. Don’t keep trying to feed your baby if he doesn’t seem interested anymore.</li>
			<li>After 9 months old, you will notice that your baby will shift to taking more solid food and less breast milk or formula. If possible, the American Academy of Pediatrics (which I agree with) recommends that you continue to breastfeed until at least 12 months.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Other tips:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Foods should be easy to chew, toddlers can't chew tough things</li>
			<li>Toddlers like colorful foods</li>
			<li>Try changing the venue of their meals: serve lunch in the playhouse, snack as an afternoon tea party</li>
			<li>Toddlers enjoy playing with their food; it is a part of learning about it</li>
			<li>Let them help in food preparation, take them to grocery store and give them <u>specific</u> choices ("Would you like carrots or broccoli?" "Should we get Cheerios or cornflakes?")</li>
			<li>Grow a vegetable garden</li>
			<li>Make food attractive, arrange food in the shape of an animal, a face, etc.</li>
			<li>Eat as a family as much as possible; kids learn by imitating what they see</li>
			<li>Help ensure that they come to the table hungry, don't use food to cure boredom or as a pacifier</li>
			<li>It's ok if they don't eat much on a single day; what matters is that they're eating enough over the course of a week to grow well</li>
			<li>Avoid forbidding foods or labeling them "special" or "treats"; if you don't want your child to eat something, keep it out of your home</li>
