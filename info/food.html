	<h2 id="early">Early Childhood Feeding Development</h2>

		<h3>When do I start introducing my baby to solid foods?</h3>
			<p>Your pediatrician will discuss starting solids with you at the 4-month visit. In general, the recommendation is to start introducing your baby to solid foods between 4-6 months of age.</p>

		<h3>When is my baby ready for solid foods?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Holds his head up well and sits with support</li>
				<li>Shows interest in food, such as watching you eat, reaching for food and opening his mouth when he sees food</li>
				<li>Starting to lose tongue thrust (seeing less pushing of food out of his mouth) when you feed him with a spoon</li>
				<li>Can suck food off a spoon without gagging or pushing the food back out</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Which foods do I start with?</h3>
			<p>There is no medical evidence that introducing solid foods in a certain order is better for babies. In the past, infant cereal was recommended as the very first solid food. While this will be an important part of your baby’s diet, it doesn’t have to be the very first food offered.</p>

			<p>Common first pureed foods:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula</li>
				<li>Baby foods made with meat</li>
				<li>Vegetables: pureed sweet potato, squash, peas, spinach, carrots, green beans, avocado</li>
				<li>Fruits: bananas, apples, pears, plums, nectarines, blueberries</li>
			</ul>

			<p>After 4-6 months you can give:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fish (well-mashed)</li>
				<li>Eggs: well-mashed, scrambled, homemade french toast with egg, blended egg in fruit</li>
				<li>Wheat (cereal/crackers that dissolve in mouth)</li>
				<li>Peanut-containing products (or other tree nuts): thinned peanut butter (mixed with formula/breastmilk/water), peanut butter mixed into applesauce, chocolate pudding, or ice cream (if tolerating milk), smoothies, batters, sauces</li>
				<li>Cheese and full-fat yogurt</li>
				<li>Dairy: yogurt or shredded cheese</li>
				<li>Soy: soy yogurt, tofu</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Wait</strong> until 12 months before giving:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Honey</li>
				<li>Cow’s milk</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Do not give foods that your baby may choke on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Hot dogs</li>
				<li>Nuts</li>
				<li>Whole grapes</li>
				<li>Large meat chunks</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Foods that cause harder stools:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Applesauce</li>
				<li>Bananas</li>
				<li>Rice</li>
				<li>Dry cereal</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Food that cause looser stools:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pears</li>
				<li>Plums</li>
				<li>Prunes</li>
				<li>Apricots</li>
				<li>Water</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>How should I start?</h3>
			<p>Eating should be a fun and social event! Here are some tips to help your baby get off to a good start with trying solid foods:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Make sure your baby is in a high chair or sitting up straight to prevent choking. Pull the high chair or seat up close to the table.</li>
				<li>Make it a point to have family meals from your baby’s first feeding.</li>
				<li>Start new foods in the morning or afternoon so you can watch for any reactions. Aim for a time when your baby isn’t very sleepy or hungry. A good time is usually 1 hour after a bottle or nursing.</li>
				<li>Serve small, bite-size portions, too much on the plate can make your child feel overwhelmed. Start with just 1-2 teaspoons of food and then increase the amount slowly over time. Try mixing the food with a little breast milk or formula to thin it out making it more “soupy” and easier to swallow.</li>
				<li>Start with 1 new food every 2-3 days. Watch for new reactions, like a rash, diarrhea or vomiting. If your baby has a reaction to a new food, stop giving it to him and call the doctor.</li>
				<li>Your baby might need to try a new food 10-15 times before he likes it. This is normal. If your baby doesn’t like a new food, try it again in a few weeks.</li>
				<li>Feed your baby until he shows signs of being full. This includes shaking his head or pushing food away. Don’t keep trying to feed your baby if he doesn’t seem interested anymore.</li>
				<li>After 9 months old, you will notice that your baby will shift to taking more solid food and less breast milk or formula. If possible, the American Academy of Pediatrics (which I agree with) recommends that you continue to breastfeed until at least 12 months.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Sensory hierarchy</h4>

				<p>If your child is having trouble handling new tastes and textures, you can try to progress along the sensory hierarchy for feeding:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Look:</strong> Present your child with new solids to look at, and tolerate on his tray/plate. Praise him for looking at crackers, cookies, puffs, etc.</li>
					<li><strong>Touch:</strong> Encourage your child to move crackers/cookies around on his plate/the table, and tolerate touching the solid. Have him place them in the middle of the plate, on the plate, off the plate, in bowls # 1, 2, 3, or stack several crackers (e.g., copy mom to pile 2 crackers on top of each other).</li>
					<li><strong>Smell:</strong> Smell foods; “Smell the first cracker…what does it smell like?” (e.g., turn taking).</li>
					<li><strong>Kiss/Lip Touches:</strong> Bring foods to lips for “kisses” or “lip touches.”</li>
					<li><strong>Tongue Touches:</strong> Lick foods/snacks in their whole form. </li>
					<li><strong>Bite and remove:</strong> Take a bite on “strong teeth” or molars and remove with hands or spit out.</li>
					<li><strong>Bite and chew, and remove</strong> from the mouth.</li>
					<li><strong>Bite and chew 3 times, move food to other side of mouth with tongue, chew 3 times, and remove.</strong></li>
					<li><strong>Bite, chew, and swallow.</strong></li>
				</ol>

		<h3>Other tips:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Foods should be easy to chew, toddlers can't chew tough things</li>
				<li>Toddlers like colorful foods</li>
				<li>Try changing the venue of their meals: serve lunch in the playhouse, snack as an afternoon tea party</li>
				<li>Toddlers enjoy playing with their food; it is a part of learning about it</li>
				<li>Let them help in food preparation, take them to grocery store and give them <u>specific</u> choices ("Would you like carrots or broccoli?" "Should we get Cheerios or cornflakes?")</li>
				<li>Grow a vegetable garden</li>
				<li>Make food attractive, arrange food in the shape of an animal, a face, etc.</li>
				<li>Eat as a family as much as possible; kids learn by imitating what they see</li>
				<li>Help ensure that they come to the table hungry, don't use food to cure boredom or as a pacifier</li>
				<li>It's ok if they don't eat much on a single day; what matters is that they're eating enough over the course of a week to grow well</li>
				<li>Avoid forbidding foods or labeling them "special" or "treats"; if you don't want your child to eat something, keep it out of your home</li>

		<h3>Portion Control and Mindful Eating</h3>
  
			<p>In a day:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&frac12; of your food should be fruits & vegetables</li>
				<li>&frac14; of your food should be grains (bread, pasta, potatoes, rice)</li>
				<li>&frac14; of your food should be protein (meat, chicken, fish, beans)</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>How can I control portions at home?</h4>

				<p>Take a standard serving out of the package and eat it off a plate instead of eating straight out of a large box or bag. This works well for snacks like potato chips.</p>

				<p>Take seconds of vegetables or salads instead of higher-fat, higher-calorie parts of a meal such as meats or desserts.</p>

				<p>When cooking in large batches, freeze food that you will not serve right away. This way, you won't be tempted to finish eating the whole batch before the food goes bad. And you'll have ready-made food for another day. Freeze in single-size meal containers.</p>
				
				<p>Try to eat three sensible meals at regular times throughout the day. Skipping meals may lead you to eat larger portions of high-calorie, high-fat foods at your next meal or snack. Eat breakfast every day.</p>

				<p>Plan your snacks. Eating too many snacks throughout the day may lead to weight gain.</p>

				<p>When you do have a treat like chips, cookies, or ice cream, eat only one serving, eat it slowly, and enjoy it!</p>
	
			<h4>What is mindful eating?</h4>

				<p>Mindful eating means paying attention to what you eat. When you take time to enjoy your food, you are less likely to overeat. Here are some ideas to help you become more mindful:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Eat slowly so your brain can get the message that your stomach is full.</li>
					<li>Stop eating when you feel full. Focus on enjoying the setting and your friends or family for the rest of the meal.</li>
					<li>Avoid eating in front of the TV, in the car, or while you are busy with other activities.</li>
					<li>Be careful about letting yourself get so busy that you forget to eat, get famished and just eat whatever you can grab. Take the time to eat regular meals throughout the day.</li>
				</ul>
