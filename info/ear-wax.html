<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Ear Wax</h1>

	<p>Ear wax is a completely normal and healthy part of the body. It's sticky to help trap dust and dirt and carry it out of the ear. Ear, nose, and throat doctors (also known as ENTs or otolaryngologists) recommend a general rule for what objects can and cannot go inside of the ear: <strong>Nothing smaller than your elbow should go in your ear.</strong></p>

<h2>Q-tips</h2>

	<p>Using Q-tips has three main risks:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Popping the ear drum:</strong> If this happens, it can heal by itself, but it is also painful, causes temporary hearing loss, and can cause scarring</li>
		<li><strong>Creating a cork of ear wax:</strong> Since Q-tips are cotton balls on sticks, they push ear wax farther into the ear and pack it together. This can cause a plug/cork of wax that can clog the ear canal, leading to hearing loss. This is not permanently harmful, but removing the wax ball can be painful.</li>
		<li><strong>Scratching the ear canal:</strong> The Q-tip can scrape the ear canal, causing some bleeding. This will heal like any other scrape, but seeing some bleeding coming out of the ear tends to scare people.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Removing Ear Wax</h2>

	<p>Some people (like me) produce ear wax faster than the tiny hairs in the ear canal can clean it out. In these cases, ear wax can build up in the ear and eventually form a plug. Since doctors advise against using Q-tips, what's the best way to clean it? <a href="https://www.debrox.com/">Debrox</a> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debrox-Drops-Earwax-Removal-Aid/dp/B0011WFO1G/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=debrox&qid=1612898068&sr=8-2">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/debrox-earwax-removal-kit-prodid-604994">CVS</a> | <a href="https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/debrox-earwax-removal-kit/ID=prod6191620-product">Walgreens</a> | <a href="https://www.riteaid.com/shop/debrox-earwax-removal-kit-1-kit-0-5-fl-oz-15-ml-2015005">Rite Aid</a> | <a href="https://www.target.com/p/debrox-earwax-removal-kit-includes-ear-drops-38-bulb-ear-syringe-0-5-fl-oz/-/A-11045261#lnk=sametab">Target</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Debrox-Earwax-Removal-Kit-0-5-fl-oz-Ear-Drops-Bulb-Ear-Syringe/23598027">Walmart</a>) contains carbamide peroxide (similar to hydrogen peroxide), which dissolves the ear wax and washes it out of the ear. There are also generic versions of Debrox available (<a href="https://www.cvs.com/shop/cvs-health-fast-acting-ear-wax-removal-system-prodid-999532">CVS</a> | <a href="https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-ear-wax-removal-kit/ID=prod6100589-product">Walgreens</a> | <a href="https://www.riteaid.com/shop/rite-aid-pharmacy-earwax-removal-kit-1-kit-0370011">Rite Aid</a> | <a href="https://www.target.com/p/ear-wax-removal-kit-0-5oz-up-38-up-8482/-/A-47771935#lnk=sametab">Target</a>). Please follow the directions on the box, but the general concept is putting a few drops in the ear, waiting a few minutes for the ear wax to dissolve, and washing the ear out with water (from an included bulb syringe). Repeat this process for a few days in a row every 3-6 months or as directed by your doctor.</p>
