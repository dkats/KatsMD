<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">COVID-19 (the 2019 coronavirus)</h1>
<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Also: SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), 2019-nCov (2019 novel coronavirus)</h3>

<p><i>Last updated: August 30, 2020</i></p>

<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

	<p>Before we dive into this virus and disease, I want to clarify the name. <span class="keyword"><q>Coronavirus</q></span> by itself doesn't mean much. The coronaviruses are actually a <em>family</em> (group) of viruses that include the common cold, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1; <q>SARS</q>), <span class="keyword">COVID-19</span>, and others. Since these have a huge range in severity, the label <q>coronavirus</q> by itself isn't scary (but also isn't reassuring). It's really just a label that doesn't give a whole lot of information. This page is about <span class="keyword">SARS-CoV-2</span>, which is the "coronavirus" pandemic that occurred from 2019&ndash;2020.</p>

	<p>What's the difference between <span class="keyword">COVID-19</span>, <span class="keyword">SARS-CoV-2</span>, and <span class="keyword">2019-nCov</span>?</p>

	<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
		<p><span class="keyword">2019-nCov</span> (which stands for: <q><u>2019</u> <u>n</u>ovel <u>co</u>rona<u>v</u>irus</q>) is the original name for the virus.</p>

		<p><span class="keyword">SARS-CoV-2</span> (which stands for: <u>s</u>evere <u>a</u>cute <u>r</u>espiratory <u>s</u>yndrome <u>co</u>rona<u>v</u>irus <u>2</u>) is the new, more descriptive name of the virus. Rather than being a novel (new) coronavirus, this name explains that it causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, meaning it causes severe and fast injury to the lungs. SARS-CoV-1 is a different virus (originally named SARS-CoV, but renamed to SARS-CoV-1 when SARS-CoV-2 was named) was responsible for the <a href="https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/" target="_blank">SARS epidemic in 2002&ndash;2004</a>.</p>

		<p><span class="keyword">COVID-19</span> (which stands for: <u>co</u>rona<u>vi</u>rus <u>d</u>isease 20<u>19</u>) is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The difference is that virus is infects you, but the disease is <em>feeling</em> sick. This is similar to strep throat, which is a disease caused by the bacterium <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. In other words, you can be infected with the virus, but can feel completely fine. Actually, this is usually the case, but some infections develop into the disease. The disease itself can also look many different ways. Some people might have a mild fever, but others might develop a severe lung injury that requires them to be put on a breathing machine.</p>
	</div>

<h2 id="presentation">Signs and Symptoms</h2>

	<p>It takes about 2&ndash;14 days after infection (usually 4&ndash;5) for the virus to build up and cause signs and symptoms. These include (most frequent to least frequent):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Fever</li>
		<li>Fatigue</li>
		<li>Dry cough</li>
		<li>Lack of appetite</li>
		<li>Muscle/body aches</li>
		<li>Shortness of breath</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These signs and symptoms are also frequently seen in other diseases, like the common cold, the flu, and seasonal allergies, which makes it hard to distinguish COVID-19 from them. It seems that fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath are particularly common in COVID-19, and diarrhea, runny nose, and sneezing are <em>un</em>common.</p>

	<p>In kids, it's much more complicated with a wider variety in symptoms. In the first group of kids for which data is available, less than half had a fever (at <em>any</em> point in the illness). Cough and throat redness were also relatively common.</p>

	<p>It is also important to point out that <strong>not everyone infected with SARS-CoV-2 will have symptoms or feel sick</strong>. Normally, we would think this is good (and it is), but it comes with a major drawback: people can feel totally fine, but can also be infected and contagious. They can then pass the virus onto other people who are at high risk for becoming severely sick. Out of people who come to the hospital feeling sick, about 80% (4 out of every 5) of cases are mild, about 15% (3 out of every 20) are severe, and about 5% are life-threatening. It is likely that many, many more people feel completely healthy and do not seek medical attention, but it is impossible for us to know (at least, at this point in time), how much more common that is.</p>

	<p>Take a look at this graph. In Italy, only the sick patients were tested, and the overwhelming majority of them were older than 50 years old. In South Korea, however, <em>everyone</em> was tested, which showed that almost <em>one-third</em> of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were between 20 and 29 years old, but had <em>no symptoms</em> and felt completely healthy.</p>

	<div class="center"><a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/1180/1*u7YJUCyLwSLtoW_O4YKOfg.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1180/1*u7YJUCyLwSLtoW_O4YKOfg.png" width="600px"></a><div class="caption"><a href="https://medium.com/@andreasbackhausab/coronavirus-why-its-so-deadly-in-italy-c4200a15a7bf" target="_blank">Backhaus, A. Coronavirus: Why it’s so deadly in Italy. <i>Medium</i>. 2020.</a></div></div>

	<p>This means that the people getting very sick and dying are elderly, but the majority of people spreading the disease are young and healthy. For young children, it is believed (based on previous research with coronaviruses, but not yet confirmed with SARS-CoV-2) that they take longer than adults to fully eliminate the virus from their systems. This means that even if they feel fine, they might be breathing out the virus and spreading it for longer than adults do.</p>

	<p><strong>If you think you are sick, <em>call</em> your local COVID-19 hotline. Do <em>not</em> show up without warning to a clinic or hospital.</strong> It's important to safely get you to the right place with the right resources. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsteps-when-sick.html" target="_blank">a webpage with steps to take if you think you may be infected with SARS-CoV-2</a>.</p>

	</div>

<h2 id="spread">How Is It Spread?</h2>

	<p>Since this is a new virus, it hasn't been thoroughly studied yet, but the general consensus is that SARS-CoV-2 is spread through the tiny water droplets that come out of the lungs during regular breathing, talking, sneezing, and coughing. These droplets can also land on surfaces and <q>wait</q> for someone to touch the surface. We don't know exactly how long the virus can survive on different surfaces, but early reports agree that it can last for at least several days.</p>

	</div>

<h2 id="preg">Pregnancy and Newborns</h2>

	<p>As of now, there are no reports of pregnant mothers passing the infection onto their children during delivery. However, it is not known whether this is possible, and most deliveries are being treated as if the mother <em>is</em> able to pass the infection on. In other words, these babies are being born by C-sections and are quickly separated from their mothers to reduce the chances of infection. As of now, breastmilk is thought to be safe, so mothers are allowed to pump and have their babies fed that way (but still with separation). Despite these precautions, there have been several reports of newborns who have tested positive for the virus, although it is unclear if they became infected during birth or shortly afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>

	<p>The absolute best ways to prevent infection/spread of the virus are to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Hand washing: for <strong>20 seconds</strong> (<strong>2</strong> Happy Birthday songs); hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol is the next best choice, but nothing is better than hand washing.</li>
		<li>Covering coughs and sneezes with your <strong>elbow</strong>, <em>not</em> your hand: sneezes launch tiny droplets filled with viruses up to 30 feet away, so cover up!</li>
		<li>Avoid touching your face, especially the eyes, nose, and mouth, because those are the only ways the virus can get into your system. It's <em>really</em> hard to not touch your face, so it takes a lot of concentration and practice to break down those habits.</li>
		<li>Avoid crowds: in general, stay <strong>at least 6 feet (2 meters)</strong> away from everyone else.</li>
		<li>Clean your house and belongings! The Centers for Disease Control have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/cleaning-disinfection.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Fhome%2Fcleaning-disinfection.html" target="_blank">a thorough webpage with lots of details and instructions on how to properly clean</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Unfortunately, given the severity of this pandemic, the above tips are important, but are not enough to save our communities. With the speed at which new cases of COVID-19 are popping up, hospitals are running out of protective masks, beds for patients, and breathing machines. With the shortage of masks, there is a high risk that doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers will get sick and unintentionally spread the virus to uninfected patients. With shortages of beds and breathing machines, hospitals will have to begin making decisions about what patients are able to get help breathing, and which are not. This is one of the worst possible situations, and is already happening in Italy, where only patients younger than 60 years old are able to get help from a breathing machine.</p>

	<p>So, what can we do about it? The short answer is that we need to slow the spread of the virus, so that the healthcare system has enough time to catch up and make space for new patients. There are many ways to do that, including isolating people who we know are sick, isolating people who we know are sick and everyone in their households, closing schools, closing public spaces, and forcing <em>everyone</em> to stay at home. These are extreme and incredibly inconvenient (at best), but they are necessary to save as many lives as possible.</p>

	<p><span class="keyword">Physical distancing</span> (formerly called "social distancing") is very important in limiting the spread of the virus and keeping people as safe as possible.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Stay at home as much as possible</strong> (get groceries no more than once per week, and stay home otherwise)</li>
		<li>Instead of going to friends' and family's homes, call, text, video chat, etc. to limit how much you're in contact with other people. The virus can't spread if people stop infecting each other.</li>
		<li>Don't gather in groups</li>
		<li>If spending time with other people, stay <strong>at least 6 feet (2 meters)</strong> away from everyone at all times.</li>
		<li>Don't shake hands or hug: the best option is to stay away and not touch people, but fist-bumping is a good middle ground to limit physical contact.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><span class="keyword">Physical distancing</span> is very hard. It's incredibly disruptive to our lives and is pretty miserable. Unfortunately, it's the best tool we have at keeping this virus from spreading until a vaccine is developed. We all have to do our part to keep our family, friends, and neighbors healthy.</p>

	<p>One of the most challenging parts of physical distancing or quarantining is having to completely change the flow of your everyday life. The American Academy of Pediatrics has <a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/AAP-Finding-Ways-to-Keep-Children-Occupied-During-These-Challenging-Times-.aspx?utm_source=MagMail&utm_medium=email&utm_term=djk175@case.edu&utm_content=AAP%20News%20E%2Dalerts%3A%20COVID%2D19%2031820&utm_campaign=Coronavirus%20Update%3A%20A%20Message%20from%20AAP%20President%20Sally%20Goza%2C%20MD%2C%20FAAP" target="_blank">a great webpage</a> with tips for how to keep your kids occupied when they are out of school for an extended time. These are also great times to work on being active and exercising. I have <a href="https://www.dancekats.com/" target="_blank">a separate website</a> with ideas for how to be active and get exercise at home without any equipment (and there are ideas that are kid-friendly).</p>

	<p>Currently, there is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but several companies are working on it. Unfortunately, developing vaccines takes a lot of time, because they have to be tested to make sure that they are both safe and effective, so the earliest that they are expected to be available is spring 2021.</p>

<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>

	<p>Mild cases can be treated at home by preventing spread of the virus to other people, staying hydrated, resting, and monitoring for worsening symptoms.</p>

	<p>Severe cases are treated in the hospital with the main addition being help with breathing. There's a wide range in how this can be done, depending on severity. The most hands-off version is with a small tube that carries extra oxygen into the nose. If that isn't good enough, a mask and breathing machine can be used to force higher amounts of air/oxygen into the lungs. The most extreme help with breathing would be with a breathing tube that would be put into the mouth and down the windpipe to carry air/oxygen from a breathing machine.</p>

	<p>There are several medications that are usually used for other diseases, but may have some role in treating COVID-19. Since this disease is fairly new, there is not much data yet, so it's hard to say what the best extra options for treatment are.</p>

	<div class="sources">
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19?search=covid&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~22&usage_type=default&display_rank=1#H3504376427" target="_blank">McIntosh, K. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <i>UpToDate</i>. 2020.</a></li>
		</ul>
	</div>

<h2 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h2>

	<p>It's hard to give a good prognosis, because there are many factors during a pandemic. Aside from the severity of the disease, a big issue is what the resources are for treating sick patients. In Italy (as of mid-March 2020), there is a huge shortage of ventilators (<q>breathing machines</q>), so they are not able to treat as many patients as they ideally would be able to, leading to deaths that would have been avoided in a perfect (well-supplied) world.</p>

	<p>Overall, it seems that recovery time is about 2 weeks for mild infections and 3&ndash;6 weeks for severe disease. Of course, these timelines change if there are complications, like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmias (problems with how the heart beats), heart injury, and shock (changes in blood vessels that lead to blood pressure dropping dangerously low).</p>

	<p>It does seem that the virus is much more severe and deadly in older people, with children only rarely needing to be admitted to the hospital and people older than 85 years old dying in 10&ndash;25% of the time. However, out of children, infants and young children appear to be the most in danger by COVID-19.</p>

<h2 id="kids">Taking Care of Kids During a Pandemic</h2>

	<p>With all of the disruptions to people's normal schedules that this pandemic has caused, kids may be confused, worrying, or asking questions. While these are difficult conversations, they are important to have. Here are some tips on how to help your kids with the transition to life with physical distancing and without school.</p>

	<p>Your kids likely know that something is different and serious, so be upfront and ask your kids what they know and ask if they have questions. Do the best you can with answering them as honestly as possible. It's ok to admit that you're worried, but also explain what you and the government have been doing to keep them safe. If your kids are also worried, validate their feelings, but also reassure them about what protections are in place.</p>

	<p>Part of the reason it's important to have these conversations, is so that your kids understand why some of their activities are limited. For example:</p>
	<ul class="minispacedlist" style="margin-top: -9pt;">
		<li>Can kids have playdates and hangout with their friends? Younger kids will not be able to maintain 6 ft of separation, so it's best to avoid playdates; however, it's perfectly safe to videochat, so they can still see and interact with their friends. Teenagers <em>may</em> be able to keep their distance from their friends, but that won't guarantee that they won't be infected. It's more complicated with kids, because they more frequently can be infected without feeling/looking sick, so they can still spread the virus to friends and family without knowing it. It's best to be safe and use phones and computers to communicate and hangout in times like these.</li>
		<li>What about bike riding? It's probably ok if all of the riders can maintain 6 ft of separation at all times.</li>
		<li>Sports? Contact sports are definitely not ok, because of close proximity while breathing heavily and spreading respiratory droplets.</li>
