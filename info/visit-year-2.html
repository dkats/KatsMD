<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">2 Year Visit</h1>

<p>Give your child <strong>choices</strong> whenever possible&mdash;like, "do you want the red plate or the blue plate." Limit it to 2 options and make sure both are possible. Letting your child feel in control will help improve their behavior and build independence.</p>

<p>Playing dress-up and <strong>pretend</strong> is an important part of learning about how others think and feel. Imagining to be someone else and do their job takes a lot of focus and energy and can build important social skills for school.</p>

<p>Know the signs that your child might be ready to <strong>potty train</strong>. These include having interest in the potty, knowing the difference between being wet and dry, being able to follow simple instructions, pooping around the same time every day, and knowing related body parts.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore picky eating</strong> and try not to force your child to eat. Avoid battles over food. Talk about healthy food options and praise your child whenever they make good choices.</p>

<p>Play games that involve movement. This helps your child practice attention, focus and self-control.</p>
