<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">6 Month Visit</h1>

<p>Say goodbye to your baby <strong>every time you leave</strong>, even if it makes your baby cry. Practicing saying goodbye will make separating from you easier in the future. Avoid sneaking out, as this can make your baby worried that you may leave at other times and that she has to keep checking.</p>

<p>What is your baby is interested in? Notice what your baby is looking at and talk about it. Learning works best when you let your baby lead the way.</p>

<p>Develop a special bedtime <strong>routine</strong> for the two of you. This can involve reading, bath, snuggles or songs! Try and find something you can do every night. Your baby will get excited for it and it can make bedtime easier.</p>

<p><strong>Reading</strong> together is a great way to introduce new words and spend quality time with your baby. Don’t worry about finishing the whole book or reading what is on the page – use the book to start a conversation and show your baby how.</p>

<p>Playing peek-a-boo will help your child learn that things and people who disappear&hellip;come back!</p>
