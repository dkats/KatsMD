<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">9 Month Visit</h1>

<p>Your child is looking to you to see how to react to new things and people. Pay attention to your own reactions – your face, body and voice – and think about what you may be telling your baby.</p>

<p>Introduce <strong>finger foods</strong>! Having your child practice picking up food and feeding themselves develops independence and is also an important step towards learning to write! Developing hand muscles and coordination is an early way to prepare for school.</p>

<p><strong>Babyproofing</strong> is a great way to help create a safe place for your baby to explore. Try and find at least one safe space for your baby to move around without having to worry about things that are dangerous. Being safe to explore on their own helps them build independence!</p>

<p>Look at things with your baby and <strong>talk</strong> about them. Paying attention to the same thing at the same time, like “I see you looking at the bus&hellip;that looks like the toy bus we have at home,” helps your child to make connections.</p>

<p>Take turns. <strong>Talk back and forth</strong> with your baby whenever you can.</p>
