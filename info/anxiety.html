<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Anxiety</h1>

	<p>Anxiety disorders include difficulties with separation from home, difficulties when asked to perform in front of a group, physical symptoms in response to stress and externalizing (aggressive or disruptive) behaviors in response to internal feelings or worries. An Anxiety Disorder may decrease energy, focus, and motivation needed for learning.</p>

<h3>School Interventions for Students with Anxiety</h3>

	<p>The following recommendations are general and may need to be adapted to specific needs depending on age, symptoms and resources.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Consideration of an Individualized Educational Plan (district-based) or a Section 504 Plan (school-based) may be appropriate for the student. The results of psychoeducational testing and classroom achievement may best be analyzed within the context of the student’s level of underlying anxiety. A Response to Intervention approach may help to determine whether the individual may benefit from adjustment to his or her curriculum or behavior plan.</li>
		<li>If there are times of emotional discharge or “melt-downs”, a Functional Behavioral Assessment may help identify precursors. Recognizing stress through body posture, restlessness, avoidance of assignments, or other cues may help the student’s teacher defuse a situation that has not yet occurred. The student may benefit from opportunities to move about the room, take a trip to the office, or touch base with a previously identified counselor, nurse, or other adult.</li>
		<li>The student may benefit from understanding his or her own times of stress. Meditation, breathing exercises, or other relaxation strategies may be implemented as a self-regulation. Contact with a school psychologist or counselor may help the student learn the strategy that works best for him or her.</li>
		<li>Times of transition may be difficult. Without drawing attention to the student, cue the entire class before changes in routine. Whenever possible, review the day’s schedule orally, in writing on the board, or for younger students with picture symbols, so that there are no surprises.</li>
		<li>If a school disaster drill is expected, the student may need advance warning. Quietly rehearsing drill routines before or after school with a trusted adult may help the student comply with the exercise without undue distress.</li>
		<li>Avoid publicly singling out the student with an anxiety disorder. He or she may already be feeling different.</li>
		<li>Provide opportunities for small group learning with supportive peers.</li>
		<li>Preferential seating, not necessarily in the front row, but so that the teacher can monitor how the student is doing, may be of benefit.</li>
		<li>If discipline of the student becomes necessary, he or she would benefit from being told they have a clean slate when the consequence has been completed. Anxious students may easily come to believe they are disliked or being singled out.</li>
		<li>The student may need to be cued before it is his or her turn to be called on. “Billy, I will be asking you to read next” or “You might be thinking of your thoughts about ___ so that you have it ready next.”</li>
		<li>The student may benefit from the use of earphones with quiet music during individual assignments. This accommodation may be offered to the whole class on a rotating basis so the student does not feel singled out when it is offered to him or her at times of stress.</li>
		<li>Every effort should be made to promote a classroom environment that helps to build individual self-esteem. Rewarding positive effort, good citizenship and prosocial skills on a regular basis will be of benefit to all students.</li>
		<li>Discuss with the student and his or her parent(s) what constitutes a reasonable expectation for time spent on homework. This student may need quiet downtime and adequate rest in order to cope with the demands of the school day.</li>
		<li>If the student needs to attend an afterschool childcare program, he or she may benefit from an opportunity to choose a quiet, solo activity.</li>
		<li>Regular contact between school and home may be essential to monitor progress and adjust expectations.</li>
