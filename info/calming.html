<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Calming Techniques for Babies</h1>

	<p>It is often challenging to find ways to calm a crying baby. Dr. Harvey Karp wrote the Happiest Baby on the Block (see the More Information section below). His 5 Ss-Swaddle, Sidelying, Shushing, Sucking, and Swaying help organize and calm even the fussiest of babies.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong><a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/blog/dudu-swaddle">Swaddle</a>:</strong> Swaddling recreates the snug packaging inside the womb and is the cornerstone of calming. It decreases startling and increases sleep. And, wrapped babies respond faster to the other 4 S’s and stay soothed longer because their arms can’t wriggle around. To swaddle correctly, wrap arms snug—straight at the side—but let the hips be loose and flexed. Use a large square blanket, but don’t overheat, cover your baby’s head or allow unraveling. Note: Babies shouldn’t be swaddled all day, just during fussing and sleep.</li>
		<li><strong>Sidelying/Stomach Position:</strong> The back is the only safe position for sleeping, but it’s the worst position for calming fussiness. This S can be activated by holding a baby on her side, on her stomach or over your shoulder. You’ll see your baby mellow in no time.</li>
		<li><strong>Shush:</strong> Contrary to myth, babies don’t need total silence to sleep. In the womb, the sound of the blood flow is a shush louder than a vacuum cleaner! But not all white noise is created equal. Hissy fans and ocean sounds often fail because they lack the womb’s rumbly quality. The best way to imitate these magic sounds is white noise.</li>
		<li><strong>Swing:</strong> Life in the womb is very jiggly. (Imagine your baby bopping around inside your belly when you jaunt down the stairs!) While slow rocking is fine for keeping quiet babies calm, you need to use fast, tiny motions to soothe a crying infant mid-squawk. My patients call this movement the "Jell-O head Jiggle." To do it, always support the head/neck, keep your motions small; and move no more than 1 inch back and forth. <strong>Never, ever shake your baby in anger or frustration.</strong> If you feel yourself getting upset or frustrated, calmly put your baby down in a safe place and take a break.</li>
		<li><strong><a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/blogs/baby/everything-you-need-to-know-about-pacifiers-sucking">Suck</a>:</strong> Sucking is "the icing on the cake" of calming. Many fussy babies relax into a deep tranquility when they suck. Many babies calm easier with a pacifier.</li>
