<p><strong>Transitions</strong>&mdash;like leaving the house, going to bed, or stopping a game&mdash;can be hard for children to manage. Prepare in advance by making a <strong>schedule</strong> like they use in school and talking about what comes next. Using timers or giving warnings like "5 minutes left" can also help.</p>

<p>Put anything and everything into <strong>groups</strong> or <strong>categories</strong>. For example, start with having your child name things that are yellow and then name things that move. Then try talking about how things can be in more than one category, like a school bus which is yellow <em>and</em> moves!</p>

<p>Ask your child <strong>questions</strong> throughout the day. Make sure you give them time to answer. When they feel like you want to hear what they say, it builds your childâ€™s confidence and success in school.</p>

<p>Use <strong>time-outs</strong> or <strong>pauses</strong> when your child hits, kicks, or is physically aggressive. Time-outs should be only 30 seconds, in a quiet place that is not for sleeping, and are <em>not</em> about punishment. Think of pauses as a chance for you and your child to calm down, take a few deep breaths, and come back to an activity.</p>

<p>Playing games where your child practices moving and stopping can help prepare him for school.</p>
