<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Bug Bites</h1>

<h3>Bedbugs</h3>
	<p>Often bite areas covered by clothing. They are difficult to see and live in mattresses and baseboards. They are difficult to get rid of. You may need to call a professional exterminator.</p>

<h3>Fleas</h3>
	<p>Commonly infest dogs and cats and can also live in carpets and furniture. If your child sits or sleeps on infested furniture, s/he may get bites all over his skin.</p>

	<p>In younger children who crawl, bites can be found all over the body from crawling on infested carpets. Remember to have household pets seen by your veterinarian and treated for fleas if needed!</p>

	<p>In older children, fleas like to bite exposed areas of skin, especially the legs.</p>

	<p>You may need to call a professional exterminator if you think there are fleas in your home.</p>

<h3>Mosquitoes</h3>
	<p>Usually bite exposed areas such as arms and legs and are most active at dusk and dawn. They like to live around still waters.</p>

<h2>Tips for keeping biting insects away</h2>
	<ul style="margin-top: 6pt;">
		<li>Avoid wooded areas and areas with standing water, especially at dusk and dawn.</li>
		<li>When outside, use netting or mesh screens over strollers.</li>
		<li>Do not use lotions or products containing perfumes.</li>
		<li>Avoid dressing your child in bright colors or flower print clothes.</li>
		<li>Keep your child covered with long-sleeved shirts and long pants if possible.</li>
		<li>Use topical insect repellents containing DEET when outside. DEET is the most effective product that repels mosquitoes, biting flies, chiggers, fleas, and ticks. </li>
	</ul>

	<p>Examples of products that contain DEET are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>OFF Skintastic for Children</li>
		<li>OFF Deep Woods DEET</li>
		<li>Sawyer Controlled-Release DEET</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Proper use of DEET products:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Apply a small amount of DEET on exposed skin; do not use under clothing.</li>
		<li>Do not apply more than once a day.</li>
		<li>Do not use DEET on the hands of young children.</li>
		<li>Avoid applying to areas around the eyes and mouth.</li>
		<li>Do not use DEET over cuts, wounds or irritated skin.</li>
		<li>Wash treated skin with soap and water after returning indoors. Wash treated clothing.</li>
		<li>Avoid spraying DEET products in enclosed areas. Do not use DEET near food.</li>
		<li>DEET should not be used in children less than 2 months of age.</li>
		<li>The maximum concentration of DEET recommended for use in children is 30%; this provides about 8 hours of protection. Products containing 10% DEET provide about 2 hours of protection.</li>
		<li>You should not use products containing both an insect repellent and a sunscreen.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You may try topical products containing other chemicals, such as picaridin or IR3535, but they are less effective. These products include: SkinSoSoft, Bug Guard Plus, OFF Botanical, Autan, and Bayrepel.</p>

	<p>0.5% permethrin spray products may be used to treat clothing. Permethrin is effective against ticks, ants, biting flies, fleas, chiggers, and mosquitos. These products include: Sawyer’s Permethrin Clothing Repellent and Sawyer’s Clothing Insect Repellent.</p>

	<p>Proper use of permethrin products:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Do not apply directly to the skin.</li>
		<li>Do not apply more than once every two weeks.</li>
		<li>Apply to clothing before getting dressed.</li>
		<li>You may use these products to treat netting, hats, sleeping bags, and other items.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Products containing citronella are the least effective.</p>
