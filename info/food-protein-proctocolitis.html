<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Food Protein-induced Proctocolitis</h1>

<p>Food protein-induced proctocolitis is an allergic condition that is limited to the rectum and distal sigmoid colon (the very end of the intestine). It occurs almost exclusively in breast-fed infants and it is most commonly associated with maternal ingestion of cow's milk (65% of the time). It can be associated with egg, corn, and soy to a lesser extent. The majority of infants are able to improve if their mom is able to remove all of these allergens from her diet. However, 12% of infants improve only after discontinuation of breast-feeding and initiation of a hypo-allergenic formula.</p>

<p>Kids will have blood-tinged or mucousy stools without any other associated symptoms. Allergy testing are not helpful, as this allergy is a different kind than what is tested by allergy tests. There is no specific testing available for this disorder.</p>

<p>Typically, kids will improve within 2 weeks with food elimination. 95% of patients will tolerate resumption of the offending food by one year of age.</p>
