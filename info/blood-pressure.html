<h3>What is blood pressure?</h3>

	<p>When the heart beats, it squeezes to push blood through the blood vessels. Then it relaxes so it can fill up with blood for the next squeeze. Blood pressure is the amount of pressure inside the blood vessels.</p>

	<p>Blood pressure has two parts:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The top/first number (systolic blood pressure) is the pressure when the heart is squeezing</li>
		<li>The bottom/second number (diastolic blood pressure) is the pressure when the heart is relaxed</li>
	</ul>

<h3>What is the normal blood pressure for my child?</h3>

	<p>The normal blood pressure for children depends on their sex, age, and height. It ranges from about 40-60/20-40 in newborns to about 110-130/60-80 in adults.</p>

	<p>If a person's blood pressure is high most of the time, we call it "hypertension". It takes more than just one blood pressure measurement to decide that a person has hypertension.</p>

<h3>What are the symptoms of hypertension?</h3>

	<p>High blood pressure can cause headaches, nausea, nosebleeds, vision problems, and even seizures. However, most people with high blood pressure do not have any symptoms.</p>

<h3>How do you know if you have hypertension?</h3>

	<p>Many people have high blood pressure when they are nervous, especially in the doctor's office. If a person has high blood pressure in the doctorâ€™s office and has normal blood pressure at home or in school, then they don't have true hypertension. We call this "white coat hypertension" because the doctor's white coat makes them nervous.</p>

	<p>The doctor may ask you to check your child's blood pressure at home to see if it is high at home. The doctor may also ask the child's school nurse to check blood pressure to see if it is high during school.</p>
