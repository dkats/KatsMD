<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Bed-wetting</h1>

<p>Nighttime bed-wetting, also called nocturnal enuresis, is quite common at up to 7 years of age, affecting as many as 10% of kids. Typically, they are very deep sleepers and soak the bed. Many children with this condition also have some degree of constipation.</p>
Â 
<p>We typically do not use medicines to treat nocturnal enuresis until about 9 years of age, unless the patient is very motivated to stay dry. Here are non-medical tips that can help:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure your child has <strong>daily, soft</strong> bowel movements; you can use prune/pear/apple juice or try some Miralax</li>
	<li>Limit evening fluid intake to no more than 2 oz for 2-3 hours before going to sleep (including fruit, ice cream, etc.)</li>
	<li>Make sure your child urinates just before going to sleep</li>
	<li>No caffeine or sugar after 5pm</li>
	<li>Consider a moisture alarm. These come in auditory and vibratory models, and some do both. The auditory alarm often wakes up other family members and not the child. It might take 4 to 6 months for this to begin working.</li>
</ul>
