<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">4 Month Visit</h1>

<p><strong>Label</strong> objects and emotions – like, “That’s a bus! Look there is a tall tree” or “I hear you crying because you’re hungry and I’m almost done making your bottle.” This helps your baby learn new words and begin to understand his or her feelings.</p>

<p>Try putting your baby to sleep <strong>drowsy, but awake</strong>. By learning to fall asleep on their own, without being in your arms, your baby is learning how to calm themselves down. This will help your baby sleep through the night too!</p>

<p>Get <strong>excited</strong> every time your baby laughs, squeals, or smiles. When you’re happy, they're happy – and knowing that you are proud of them helps them to grow and develop.</p>

<p>Try to have your baby feed and sleep around the <strong>same time every day</strong>. This can make it easier for your baby to develop a <strong>routine</strong> and make them less fussy.</p>

<p>Match your face to your baby’s! Smile when they smile, make a sad face when they cry, and giggle when they giggle!</p>
