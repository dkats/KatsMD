<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Newborn Visit</h1>

<p>Babies see best up close, so put your face close to theirs. <strong>Faces</strong> are a great toy for newborns to learn from.</p>

<p>Respond to your baby’s cries. This is the best way to build your relationship and trust. Remember, you <strong>can’t spoil a baby by responding to their cries</strong>.</p>

<p>Sleep is so important for early brain development. Keeping a newborn awake during the day will not help him sleep better at night. To keep your baby from getting too tired, try to get your baby to sleep after being awake for 1.5-2 hours.</p>

<p>Act like a <strong>sportscaster</strong> on TV and tell your baby everything you are doing and everything going on around them. Fill your baby’s day with words. This teaches them early language skills.</p>

<p><strong>Touch</strong> is so important to build your baby’s brain cells and to help your baby feel loved.</p>
