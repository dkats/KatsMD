<p>Babies see best up close, so put your face close to theirs. <strong>Faces</strong> are a great toy for newborns to learn from.</p>

<p>Respond to your baby’s cries. This is the best way to build your relationship and trust. Remember, you <strong>can’t spoil a baby by responding to their cries</strong>.</p>

<p>Sleep is so important for early brain development. Keeping a newborn awake during the day will not help him sleep better at night. To keep your baby from getting too tired, try to get your baby to sleep after being awake for 1.5-2 hours.</p>

<p>Act like a <strong>sportscaster</strong> on TV and tell your baby everything you are doing and everything going on around them. Fill your baby’s day with words. This teaches them early language skills.</p>

<p><strong>Touch</strong> is so important to build your baby’s brain cells and to help your baby feel loved.</p>

<h3 style="color: red;">Red Flags</h3>

	<p><strong>Fever:</strong> In babies younger than 28 days old, a fever is a <strong>medical emergency</strong>. A fever is a temperature ≥100.4 &deg;F (38 &deg;C). In young babies, being to <em>cold</em>, which we define as ≤97.7 &deg;F (36.5 &deg;C), is also a medical emergency. Remember to follow your thermometer's instructions; some require you to add 1 &deg;F to the measurement.</p>

	<p><strong>Spitting up:</strong> Spitting up is almost always <strong>normal</strong> in babies. Normal spit up is the same color as formula/milk, but it might be chunky from the milk curdling in the stomach acid. Spit up should <u>not</u> be: <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green/neon</strong>, or so powerful that it will <strong>repaint your ceiling</strong>.</p>
