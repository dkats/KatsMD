<h2>Basic Seizure First Aid</h2>   		                                      
	<ul>
		<li>Stay calm & track <strong>time</strong>; most seizures last a few minutes</li>
		<li>If the seizure continues for <strong>longer than 5 minutes</strong>, call 911</li>
		<li>Keep child <strong>safe</strong>: move any nearby objects out of the way</li>
		<li>Do <strong>not</strong> restrain/hold down</li>
		<li>Do <strong>not</strong> put anything in the childâ€™s mouth other than rescue medication prescribed by a physician</li>
		<li><strong>Administer emergency medicine</strong> prescribed by doctor (if applicable)</li>
		<li>Stay with child until fully conscious</li>
		<li>Do not give the person anything to eat or drink until they are <strong>fully</strong> alert</li>
		<li><strong>Video record</strong> seizure and/or <strong>write down</strong> a description of the seizure (paint a picture with your words)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Protect head</li>
		<li>Keep airway open/watch breathing</li>

<h2>Seizure Precautions/Safety</h2>

	<p>Usually these restrictions are maintained for at least 6 seizure-free months before consideration is given for lifting them. These restrictions are meant to protect your child and are based on the experiences of neurologists treating patients with epilepsy/seizures.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>No swimming.</li>
		<li>No baths. Your child should take showers. If your child is an infant or toddler and needs a bath, you should be with them at all times during the baths, without exception.</li>
		<li>If your child is an infant or toddler, do not allow them close to any source of water&mdash;such as buckets, wading pools, and toilets&mdash;without accompaniment.</li>
		<li>No climbing high places such as cliffs, high bar gymnastics, jungle gyms, etc. If your child is a toddler, he/she should not be allowed to climb a ladder to a slide unaccompanied.</li>
		<li>No driving, skiing, snowboarding, rollerblading, or skateboarding. Riding a bicycle with a helmet is ok.</li>
		<li>Regardless of your child's age, he/she should never be in a locked room at any time.</li>
		<li>If your child has been 6 months seizure free, you can discuss with your neurologist about potentially lifting some or all of these restrictions.</li>
	</ul>
