<p>Doing activities <strong>together</strong> builds the important relationship between you and your child. Find time to do something special and talk about how much you enjoy being together! Your relationship teaches your child about what to expect from future relationships.</p>

<p>It’s important to let kids know that <strong>everyone can improve</strong> and get smarter each day. Praise your child when they put a lot of practice or hard work into an activity, even if they don’t win. Saying "you can’t do it <strong>yet</strong>, but you’ll learn" helps your child believe they can always improve and achieve!</p>

<p><strong>Try not to shame</strong> your child when they do something wrong. If they feel like there is something wrong with them, instead of just their behavior, it can make them feel less confident about themselves and their abilities in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Talk about what other people think and feel</strong> whenever you can. Connect your child’s actions to feelings, like "when you ask me nicely, it makes me to feel happy" or "when you took that from your brother, you made him sad and that is why he is crying." Understanding others will help your child with social skills and behavior in school.</p>

<p>Playing games that require concentration are challenging and fun!</p>
