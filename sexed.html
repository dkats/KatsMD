	<p>Hello! Welcome to my sex ed website.</p>

	<p>I am currently a Pediatrics Resident doctor and I hope to help kids learn about how their bodies work.</p>

	<p>Why do I care about sex ed? During medical school, I taught sed ed classes in local middle schools and the county's juvenile detention center, which showed me just how awful sex education is in public schools. The teachers I met were very well-meaning and asked great questions during the sessions, but how could they be expected to teach sex ed to the kids if they didn't know the answers themselves? Who could the kids ask questions to that came up during the year when we weren't there to answer them? The kids I met were incredibly engaged and thoughtful, but a large proportion of them were already sexually active&mdash;some even had their own kids already&mdash;so we were getting this information to them too late. The goal of this website is to fix that. I want sex ed to be comprehensive (not just an hour here and there during the school day), free, and accessible. I also want to help teachers access this information so that they could educate themselves and be able to help their students as much as possible.</p>

	<p>I'd love to hear your feedback (what worked well, what wasn't explained well, what was awful), so please use the "Contact" button in the bottom right corner to email me and questions, comments, or advice. Thanks!</p>

	<p><strong>Please note, this website is <em>not</em> meant to cover every single aspect of sex ed. It's meant to be a starting point that covers the basics with lots of links and references to places where you can learn more. If something's missing that you think should be covered (or there isn't a resource listed), please hut the "Contact" button in the bottom right and let me know.</strong></p>

	<p>Before we start, let's go over some basic suggestions for safety:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Set up parental controls to allow web filtering. This can be done in several ways, including through your internet provider or cell service contract, directly on the device (instructions should be in the manual), and through site-specific services (offered by popular sites, including YouTube, NetFlix, and Facebook).</li>
		<li>Review the browsing history regularly.</li>
		<li>Disable location-tagging on mobile devices. A GPS-enabled smartphone can reveal your child's location through online posts and uploaded photos.</li>
		<li>Teach your child that information shared on the internet is not private.</li>
		<li>Review information that should not be shared (personal details, passwords, credit card numbers).</li>
		<li>Explain the limits to online relationships. Emphasize that it's ok to say "no" to requests for personal information, photos, money, and joining social media networks.</li>
		<li>Encourage your child not to delete messages, including those that are hurtful or don't feel right. Tell them to save anything that they're not sure about and set aside time to review the messages together.</li>
		<li>Ask questions! What websites do you like to visit? Have you ever seen something online that made you feel sad, scared or confused? What would you do if you saw something online that made you uncomfortable?</li>
		<li>Learn how to use the social media websites that your child is using. Ask them to show you how it works and specifically how he or she uses it.</li>
	</ul>
