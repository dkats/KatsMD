	<p>Hello! Welcome to my sex ed website.</p>

	<p>I am currently a fourth year medical student, set to graduate in May 2020, and I will be starting training to become a pediatrician.</p>

	<p>Why do I care about sex ed? During medical school, I taught sed ed classes in local middle schools and the county's juvenile detention center, which showed me just how awful sex education is in public schools. The teachers I met were very well-meaning and asked great questions during the sessions, but how could they be expected to teach sex ed to the kids if they didn't know the answers themselves? Who could the kids ask questions to that came up during the year when we weren't there to answer them? The kids I met were incredibly engaged and thoughtful, but a large proportion of them were already sexually active&mdash;some even had their own kids already&mdash;so we were getting this information to them too late. The goal of this website is to fix that. I want sex ed to be comprehensive (not just an hour here and there during the school day), free, and accessible. I also want to help teachers access this information so that they could educate themselves and be able to help their students as much as possible.</p>

	<p>I'd love to hear your feedback (what worked well, what wasn't explained well, what was awful), so please use the "Contact" button in the bottom right corner to email me and questions, comments, or advice. Thanks!</p>

	<p><strong>Please note, this website is <em>not</em> meant to cover every single aspect of sex ed. It's meant to be a starting point that covers the basics with lots of links and references to places where you can learn more. If something's missing that you think should be covered (or there isn't a resource listed), please hut the "Contact" button in the bottom right and let me know.</strong></p>
