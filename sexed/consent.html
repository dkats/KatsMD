	<h1>Consent</h1>

	<div class="disclaim">This is <em>not</em> legal advice. I am not a lawyer and have not studied law. This is purely based on common sense. If there's ever any doubt that you have consent, err on the side of caution and play it safe (<em>don't</em> do whatever you were planning on doing).</div>

	<h2>What Is Consent?</h2>

		<p>Consent is the most important, but the easiest thing you will learn. In a nutshell, it means you should only do things with which your partner(s) is/are comfortable. The most important part is that they have to <em>tell</em> you that they're comfortable. Assuming is <em>not</em> ok.</p>

		<p>Now, telling doesn't have to be verbal. There are many ways to get consent, but you need to do it.</p>

	<h2>The Four Cs</h2>

		<p><u><strong>C</strong></u>lear​: everyone knows exactly what they are consenting to</p>
		<p><u><strong>C</strong></u>ontinuous​: checking in with the other party to make sure they are still comfortable with what is happening BEFORE moving on to a new action</p>
		<p><u><strong>C</strong></u>onscious​: not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, fully awake, and able to make full decision</p>
		<p>Free​ ​of​ ​<u><strong>C</strong></u>oercion​: not using threats or force (verbal, physical, emotional) to persuade someone to do something</p>

	<h2>Who Needs Consent?</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>EVERYONE</li>
			<li>Boys</li>
			<li>Girls</li>
			<li>Kids</li>
			<li>Adults</li>
			<li>Aliens</li>
			<li>Literally everyone</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Who Are the Victims of Sexual Assault?</h2>

		<p>The majority of sexual assault victims are under 30 years old and are women. That being said, <em>any kind of person</em> can and has been a victim of sexual assault. For some graphs and statistics, check out <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence">this website</a> from RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network), which is a large anti-sexual violence organization.</p>

		<div class="center"><img src="files/rainn_men.png" width="500px;" /></div> -->

		<p>Women are <em>not</em> the only victims of sexual assault. While they are assaulted more than men, men still are assaulted relatively frequently. According to <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvsv9410.pdf">a U.S. Department of Justice report</a>, approximately 1 out of every 10 victims of sexual assault is male. Yet, because it's not "manly" to be assaulted, men are much less likely than women to report that they were assaulted and seek help.</p>

	<h2>What Does Consent Actually Look Like?</h2>

		<div class="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KT5KK551aeg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

		<p>Does this video seem forced and unnatural? Absolutely! But that's not the point. It's just to get you thinking about how you might ask for consent and how you can react no matter what the answer is. Everyone will have their own way of asking, and that's ok. There's no one way to ask for consent, as long as you ask in an obvious way so that everyone is on the same page and no one is misunderstood.</p>

	<h2>Situations</h2>

		<h3>What If They Say "No"?</h3>

			<p><strong>Respect it.</strong> Everyone has the right to control what happens to their bodies. It's that simple. Is it unpleasant to hear "No" or to have your hand pushed off of someone's body? Of course. No one wants to hear that. But, you don't have the right to force anyone to do anything that they don't want to do. If you hear "No," have your hand pushed off, or get anything that isn't an <em>obvious</em> "Yes!", move on.</p>

			<p><strong>Don't</strong> keep asking (that gets you into <u><strong>c</strong></u>oercion.</p>

		<h3>What If They're Drunk/High?</h3>

			<p>Having sex or doing any other sexual act with someone who's drunk is <em>not</em> necessarily assault. It depends on the situation. Did you talk about it before hand and decide that it would be ok? As long as they're consistent with giving consent while sober, while under the influence, and during sex, then you have consent.</p>

			<p>Someone who's under the influence of alcohol or a drug <strong>cannot</strong> give consent. So, if you meet them after they're intoxicated, you <strong>cannot</strong> get consent.</p>

			<div class="center"><p><strong>If you have <em>any</em> doubts, don't do it.</strong></p></div>

			<div class="center"><p><strong>Better safe than sorry.</strong></p></div>
