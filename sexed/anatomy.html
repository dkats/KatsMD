	<h1>Anatomy and Physiology (How the Body Works)</h1>

	<!-- TODO: at some point, talk about douching and hygeine -->

	<h2>Body Parts</h2>

	<h3>Male</h3>

		<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
		<p><strong>Scrotum:</strong> The bag of skin that contains the testicles. It keeps them at the right temperature, which is slightly cooler than the rest of the body, by shrinking and expanding. If the temperature gets too warm, the sperm won't develop well. During puberty, the scrotum gets bigger/baggier and turns a slightly darker color.</p>
		<p><strong>Testicle/testis:</strong> (Plural: testicles/testes) The organ that makes sperm and testosterone. Usually hang at slightly different heights, which is totally normal.</p>
		<p><strong>Epididymis:</strong> Attaches to the back of each testicle and is where the sperm "learn" to swim and finish developing.</p>
		<p><strong>Vas deferens:</strong> (Pronounced "vaz DEF-er-enz") A tube that connects the epididymis (on each testicle) to the seminal vesicle. This is what carries sperm from the scrotum to inside the body (toward the penis) before ejaculation.</p>
		<p><strong>Seminal vesicle:</strong> Where sperm combine with fluid to make semen.</p>
		<p><strong>Prostate:</strong> Adds nutrients to semen</p>
		<p><strong>Urethra:</strong> Tube through which urine and semen leave the body (through the penis).</p>
		<p><strong>Penis:</strong> Organ that hangs outside the body and is used for urination and ejaculation. There is a <em>wide</em> range of shapes and sizes, which are determined by our genes and random chance. <em>The size and shape have <em>nothing</em> to do with "manliness"</em>.</p>
		</div>

	<h3>Female</h3>

		<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
		<p><strong>Vulva:</strong> All of the external parts of the female sex organs (what you can see from the outside).</p>
		<p><strong>Labia majora:</strong> "Labia" is Latin for lip and "majora" is Latin for great, which in this context means large. The labia majora are the folds of skin between a female-bodied person's legs that cover the vaginal opening.</p>
		<p><strong>Labia minora:</strong> "Labia" is Latin for lip and "minora" is Latin for lesser. The labia minora are the folds of tissue between the labia majora that cover the vaginal opening. Going from outside inward, there are the legs, labia majora, labia minor, and then the vaginal opening.</p>
		<p><strong>Clitoris:</strong> A bump of tissue, about the size of a pea, where the labia minora meet in front. Inside it is a bundle of nerves that are very sensitive to touch, just like there are many nerves in the tip of the penis.</p>
		<p><strong>Urethra:</strong> The tube through which urine leaves the body (it connects the bladder to the outside world). It opens through a little hole between the clitoris and the vaginal opening. It is usually covered by the labia minora.</p>
		<p><strong>Vagina:</strong> A connection between the uterus and the outside world. This is where a penis would go during sex.</p>
		<!-- TODO: G-spot -->
		<p><strong>Hymen:</strong> A thin piece of skin that <em>may</em> cover part of the opening. It is often small or missing and can break <em>without</em> sex. Unfortunately, checking for a hymen is frequently&mdash;and <em>incorrectly</em>&mdash;used to see if a female-bodied person is a virgin; however, this <em>does not work!</em> There is <u>no test</u> for virginity other than asking the person.</p>
		<p><strong>Cervix:</strong> Lower part of the uterus that forms a tight seal between the vagina and the rest of the uterus to keep the uterus sterile. It also makes mucus to keep sperm alive. The only things that can travel through the cervix are menstrual fluid (“blood”) and sperm. During labor, it opens and widens to let the baby come out. During sex, the penis <em>cannot</em>get through the cervix and only stays in the vagina.</p>
		<p><strong>Uterus:</strong> (Also known as the "womb") It's a huge pear-sized muscle and is where a developing baby (fetus) grows and is fed. It is also where “the period” comes from (we'll talk about this later).</p>
		<p><strong>Uterine tube:</strong> (Also known as a Fallopian tube) A tube between the uterus and an ovary (there are two ovaries, so there are two uterine tubes, one on the left and one on the right). This is where an egg cell meets the sperm to make a fetus.</p>
		<p><strong>Ovary:</strong> Where the egg cells (also called "ova") are stored and released. Also produces hormones, like estrogen.</p>

	<h2>Eggs and Sperm</h2>

		<!-- TODO: better explanation of sex cells -->

	<h3>How Are Sperm Released?</h3>

		<p>Sperm are stored in the epididymis. When it's time for them to be released (ejaculation), muscles squeeze them from the epididymis, through the vas deferens, and into the seminal vesicles. There, they combine with fluid to make semen, which travels through the urethra into and out of the penis. Usually, the penis is erect during this, which happens when the blood vessels in the penis cause increased blood flow. The blood fills the penis and makes it stiff, like how those party balloon animals get inflated with air.</p>

		<!-- TODO: finish -->

	<h3>How Are Egg Cells Released?</h3>

		<p>Girls are born with hundreds of thousands of tiny egg cells (also called "ova", OH-va; one is called an "ovum", OH-vum). In kids, these egg cells are only half-formed, At puberty, hormones tell the ovaries restart development of the ova and to slowly release them every month. Usually, one ovum develops and is released from an ovary every month, but sometimes two or none can be released.</p>

		<p>While an ovum develops in the ovary, the uterus starts to grow a thick lining on the inside wall. The lining is there to protect and feed a fertilized egg, which is an egg that has combined with a sperm, in case that happens. The uterus has to be ready whether the egg is fertilized or not, because it takes about 2 weeks for the lining to grow enough to support a fetus. This cycle of developing an ovum and releasing it happens every month (until the ova run out).</p>

		<p>If the egg is not fertalized, it won't stick to the wall of the uterus and will just flow out from the uterus into the vagina and out of the body. Then, the lining of the uterus, which has fully grown by this point, breaks down and also flows out of the uterus, through the vagina, and out to the outside world. This is a "period" (also called a "menstrual cycle").</p>

		<!-- TODO: finish -->

	<h2>Pregnancy</h2>

		<p>When a sperm and an egg cell meet, they combine to form a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg then travels from the uterine tube into the uterus and implants into the uterine lining. When this happens, the female-bodied person becomes pregnant. The fertilized egg begins growing and developing and has many different stages. At first, it's called a zygote (z-EYE-goat), which becomes an embryo (EM-bree-yo), and the embryo develops into a fetus (FEE-tus). When a fetus is born, it becomes a baby. This whole process usually takes about 38 to 42 weeks (9 months), but sometimes babies are born prematurely (early).</p>

		<!-- TODO: Find picture of stages of embryo development -->

	<h2>Puberty</h2>

		<p>Puberty is when young bodies develop into adult bodies. There are many changes, but the most important ones are that people develop new feelings and interests and either their egg cells continue to develop or their sperm begin to be made. The egg cells develop while in the womb and pause their development until puberty when they continue. New egg cells are <em>not</em> made after birth. Sperm are not made at all until puberty, but they are constantly made from scratch (<em>hundreds of thousands</em> every day. This means that female-bodied peopel can run out of egg cells (which is called menopause), but male-bodied people will not run out of sperm. As males age, their sperm tend to have more and more problems, but there are usually enough well-functioning sperm to be able to get someone pregnant.</p>

		<p>The changes in puberty are triggered by a hormone that is made in a part of the brain called the pituitary gland. This hormone travels through the blood to the testicles and ovaries, which then make other hormones, including testosterone and estrogen.</p>

		<p>There are many, many other changes that happen, including:</p>
		<table>
			<tr><td>Females</td>
				<td><ul>
					<li>Get taller and heavier</li>
					<li>Bones grow bigger and heavier</li>
					<li>Hips get wider and more curvy</li>

		</table>

		<!-- TODO: Worksheet comparing male/female changes -->

		<p>Notice that many of these changes are the same for male- and female-bodied people. Society puts a lot of stress on the differences and has some double-standards (e.g., it's more important for girls to smell good than it is for boys), but many of the changes happen in everyone.</p>

		<p>So, what are the differences between males and females? The main ones are that males get facial hair, their shoulders get wider, the penis and testicles grow, and they begin to have wet dreams (when they ejaculate while dreaming). Females' hips get wider and they begin releasing egg cells ("ovulation").

	<h3>What's the Purpose of Sperm and Egg Cells?</h3>

		<p>DNA is like the instruction manual for our cells to function. Sperm and eggs each have one half of that instruction manual. When they combine, they make a baby with a full set of instructions.</p>

	<h3>Why Does Puberty Happen?</h3>

		<p>Hormones are chemicals that the body uses to send messages. The brain uses "sex hormones" to communicate with the "sex organs" (e.g., breasts, genitals) to tell them to develop. The main sex hormones are <span style="color: orange;">testosterone</span> and <span style="color: green;">estrogen</span>. Both males and females make both, but in different amounts. <span style="color: orange;">Males</span> make lots of <span style="color: orange;">testosterone</span>, not so much estrogen. <span style="color: green;">Females</span> make lots of <span style="color: green;">estrogen</span>, not so much testosterone.</p>

	<h3>When Does Puberty Happen?</h3>

		<p>Puberty usually happens between 8- and 17-years-old. For female-bodied people, it usually starts between 10 and 13; for male-bodied people, usually between 12 and 14. That being said, there is huge amounts of variation and everyone's body is different. When you start makes no difference to how you develop; no age is better than any other one. Most of the changes happen in a few years, but can happen slowly over many years.</p>

		<p>The important takeaway is that: <strong>No matter when or how you develop, IT IS NORMAL!!</strong></p>

		<div class="TFq">Teens who get a lot of pimples do not wash often enough.</div>
		<script type="text/javascript">true_false("pimples", false, "", "", "During puberty, the body begins making a lot of oils, which can clog up your skin and cause pimples. This is <em>completely</em> normal! Washing can help a bit, but will <em>not</em> make it go away completely. There are medicines that your doctor can prescribe to help, but they have strong side effects and should be used with extreme caution.");</script>

		<div class="TFq">All girls are emotional and tearful before their periods.</div>
		<script type="text/javascript">true_false("pmsemotions", false, "", "", "During puberty, emotions change and some people do get more emotional during their periods than they are at other times. This is totally normal and is caused by the hormones that help the body mentruate. Interestingly, male-bodied people also have hormones that have a monthly cycle, but society doesn't point this out very often.");</script>

		<div class="TFq">All girls get really emotional during puberty.</div>
		<script type="text/javascript">true_false("pubertyemotions", false, "", "", "During puberty, emotions do change and can become more intense. This happens EQUALLY to BOYS AND GIRLS.");</script>

	<h2>Sex</h2>

	<h3>Types of Sex</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Vaginal sex: penis-in-vagina intercourse</li>
		<li>Oral sex: mouth-to-genital contact</li>
		<li>Anal sex: penis-in-anus intercourse</li>
		<li>Fingering or hand jobs: hand-to-genital contact</li>
		<li>Dry humping: genital rubbing</li>
		<li>Touching yourself: masturbation</li>
	</ul>

	<p><em>All</em> of these sexual activities, except masturbation, can carry the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</p>
