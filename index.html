	<p>My name's Dan Kats, and I'm currently a Clinical Informatics fellow at <span class="tooltip">Boston Children's Hospital<span class="tooltiptext">Disclaimer: This website is <em>not</em> affiliated with Boston Children's</span></span> (2023&ndash;2025). I completed my Pediatrics residency training at <span class="tooltip">Massachusetts General Hospital <em>for</em> Children in Boston, MA<span class="tooltiptext">Disclaimer: This website is <em>not</em> affiliated with MGH<em>f</em>C</span></span> (2020&ndash;2023). This website is where I provide clinical resources and education for my patients and the general population, as well as some resources for clinicians (mostly myself, but others are welcome to use anything they think is useful). All of the information on this site is written by me (with references provided as much as possible), but is strictly for educational purposes and should <em>not</em> be used as healthcare advice.
